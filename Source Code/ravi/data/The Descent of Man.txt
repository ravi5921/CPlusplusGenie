PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. 


During the successive reprints of the first edition of 
this work, published in 1871, I was able to introduce 
several important corrections ; and now that more 
time has elapsed, I have endeavoured to profit by the 
fiery ordeal through which the book has passed, and 
have taken advantage of all the criticisms which seem 
to me sound. I am also greatly indebted to a large 
number of correspondents for the communication of a 
surprising number of new facts and remarks. These 
have been so numerous, that I have been able to use 
only the more important ones ; and of these, as well as 
of the more important corrections, I will append a list. 
Some new illustrations have been introduced, and four 
of the old drawings have been replaced by better ones, 
done from life by Mr. T. W. Wood. I must especially 
call attention to some observations which I owe to the 
kindness of Prof. Huxley (given as a supplement at the 
end of Part I.), on the nature of the differences between 
the brains of man and the higher apes. I have been 
particularly glad to give these observations, because 
during the last few years several memoirs on the 
subject have appeared on the Continent, and their 
importance has been, in some cases, greatly ex- 
aggerated by popular writers. 


viii PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. 

I may take this opportunity of remarking that my 
critics frequently assume that I attribute all changes 
of corporeal structure and mental power exclusively to 
the natural selection of such variations as are often 
called spontaneous ; whereas, even in the first edition 
of the ‘Origin of Species,’ I distinctly stated that 
great weight must be attributed to the inherited 
effects of use and disuse, with respect both to the 
body and mind. I also attributed some amount of 
modification to the direct and prolonged action of 
changed conditions of life. Some allowance, too, 
must be made for occasional reversions of structure; 
nor must we forget what I have called “ correlated ” 
growth, meaning, thereby, that various parts of the 
organisation are in some unknown manner so con- 
nected, that when one part varies, so do others ; and 
if variations in the one are accumulated by selection, 
other parts will be modified. Again, it has been said 
by several critics, that when I found that many details 
of structure in man could not be explained through 
natural selection, I invented sexual selection ; I gave, 
however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in 
the first edition of the ‘ Origin of Species,’ and I there 
stated that it was applicable to man. This subject of 
sexual selection has been treated at full length in the 
present work, simply because an opportunity was 
here first afforded me. I have been struck with the 
likeness of many of the half-favourable criticisms on 
sexual selection, with those which appeared at first on 
natural selection ; such as, that it would explain some 
few details, but certainly was not applicable to the 
extent to which I have employed it. My conviction of 
the power of sexual selection remains unshaken ; but it

is probable, or almost certain, that several of my 
conclusions will hereafter be found erroneous ; this 
can hardly fail to be the case in the first treatment of 
a subject. When naturalists have become familiar 
with the idea of sexual selection, it will, as I believe, 
be much more largely accepted; and it has already 
been fully and favourably received by several capable 
iudges.

THE DESCENT OE MAN ; 

AND 


SELECTION IN RELATION TO SEX. 


INTRODUCTION. 

The nature of the following work will be best under- 
stood by a brief account of how it came to be written. 
During many years I collected notes on the origin or 
descent of man, without any intention of publishing 
on the subject, but rather with the determination not 
to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to 
the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me 
sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my ‘ Origin 
of Species,’ that by this work “ light would be thrown 
“ on the origin of man and his history ; ” and this 
implies that man must be included with other organic 
beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner 
of appearance on this earth. Now the case wears a 
wholly different aspect. When a naturalist like Carl 
Vogt ventures to say in his address as President of the 
National Institution of Geneva (1869), ‘‘personne, en 
“Europe au moins, n’ose plus soutenir la creation 

B

INTRODUCTION. 


“ independante et de toutes pieces, des especes,” it is 
manifest that at least a large number of naturalists 
must admit that species are the modified descendants 
of other species ; and this especially holds good with 
the younger and rising naturalists. The greater 
number accept the agency of natural selection ; 
though some urge, whether with justice the future 
must decide, that I have greatly overrated its im- 
portance. Of the older and honoured chiefs in natural 
science, many unfortunately are still opposed to 
evolution in every form. 

In consequence of the views now adopted by most 
naturalists, and which will ultimately, as in every 
other case, be followed by others who are not scientific, 
I have been led to put together my notes, so as to see 
how far the general conclusions arrived at in my 
former works were applicable to man. This seemed 
all the more desirable, as I had never deliberately 
applied these views to a species taken singly. When 
we confine our attention to any one form, we are 
deprived of the weighty arguments derived from the 
nature of the affinities which connect together whole 
groups of organisms — their geographical distribution 
in past and present times, and their geological 
succession. The homological structure, embryological 
development, and rudimentary organs of a species 
remain to be considered, whether it be man or any 
other animal, to which our attention may be directed ; 
but these great classes of facts afford, as it appears to 
me, ample and conclusive evidence in favour of the 
principle of gradual evolution. The strong support 
derived from the other arguments should, however, 
always be kept before the mind. 


INTRODUCTION. 


3 


The sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, 
whether man, like every other species, is descended 
from some pre-existing form ; secondly, the manner of 
his development ; and thirdly, the value of the differ- 
ences between the so-called races of man. As I shall 
confine myself to these points, it will not be necessary 
to describe in detail the differences between the several 
races — an enormous subject which has been fully 
discussed in many valuable works. The high antiquity 
of man has recently been demonstrated by the labours 
of a host of eminent men, beginning with M. Boucher 
de Perthes ; and this is the indispensable basis for 
understanding his origin. I shall, therefore, take this 
conclusion for granted, and may refer my readers to 
the admirable treatises of Sir Charles Lyell, Sir John 
Lubbock, and others. Nor shall I have occasion to do 
more than to allude to the amount of difference 
between man and the anthropomorphous apes; for 
Prof. Huxley, in the opinion of most competent 
judges, has conclusively shewn that in every visible 
character man differs less from the higher apes, than 
these do from the lower members of the same order of 
Primates. 

This work contains hardly any original facts in 
regard to man ; but as the conclusions at which I 
arrived, after drawing up a rough draft, appeared -to 
me interesting, I thought that they might interest 
others. It has often and confidently been asserted, 
that man’s origin can never be known : but ignorance 
more frequently begets confidence than does know- 
ledge : it is those who know little, and not those who 
know much, who so positively assert that this or that 
problem will never be solved by science. The con- 


4 


INTRODUCTION. 


elusion that man is the co-descendant with other 
species of some ancient, lower, and extinct form, is 
not in any degree new. Lamarck long ago came to 
this conclusion, which has lately been maintained by 
several eminent naturalists and philosophers ; for 
instance, by Wallace, Huxley, Lyell, Vogt, Lubbock, 
Biichher, Eolle, &c.,^ and especially by Hackel. This 
last naturalist, besides his great work, ‘ Generelle 
Morphologie ’ (1866), has recently (1868, with a 
second edit, in 1870), published his ‘ Natiirliche 
Schopfungsgeschichte,’ in which he fully discusses the 
genealogy of man. If this work had appeared before 
my essay had been written, I should probably never 
have completed it. Almost all the conclusions at 
which 1 have arrived I find confirmed by this 
naturalist, whose knowledge on many points is much 
fuller than mine. Wherever I have added any fact or 
view from Prof. Hackel’s writings, I give his authority 
in the text ; other statements I leave as they originally 
stood in my manuscript, occasionally giving in the 
foot-notes references to his works, as a confirmation of 
the more doubtful or interesting points. 


^ As the works of the first- 
named authors are so well known, 
I need not give the titles; but 
as those of the latter are less 
well known in England, I will 
give them : — ‘Seeks Vorlesungen 
liber die Darwin’sche Theorie : ’ 
zweite Aufiage, 1868, von Dr. 
L. Buchner ; translated into 
French under the title ‘ Con- 
ferences sur la Theorie Darwin- 
ienne,’ 1869. ‘ Der Mensch, im 

Lichte der Darwin’sche Lehre,’ 
1865, von Dr. F. Rolle. I will 
not attempt to give references 


to aU the authors who have 
taken the same side of the 
question. Thus Gr. Canestrini 
has published (‘Annuario della 
Soc. d. Nat.,’ Modena, 1867, p. 
81) a very curious paper on 
rudimentary characters, as bear- 
ing on the origin of man. 
Another work has (1869) been 
published by Dr. Francesco 
Barrago, bearing in Italian the 
title of “Man, made in the 
“ image of God, was also made 
“ in the image of the ape.” 


INTRODUCTION. 


5 

During many years it has seemed to me highly 
probable that sexual selection has played an important 
part in differentiating the races of man ; but in my 
‘ Origin of Species ’ (first edition, p. 199) I contented 
myself by merely alluding to this belief. When I 
came to apply this view to man, I found it indis- 
pensable to treat the whole subject in full detail.^ 
Consequently the second part of the present work, 
treating of sexual selection, has extended to an 
inordinate length, compared with the first part; but 
this could not he avoided. 

1 had intended adding to the present volumes an 
essay on the expression of the various emotions by 
man and the lower animals. My attention was called 
to this subject many years ago by Sir Charles BelFs 
admirable work. This illustrious anatomist maintains 
that man is endowed with certain muscles solely for 
the sake of expressing his emotions. As this view is 
obviously opposed to the belief that man is descended 
from some other and lower form, it was necessary for 
me to consider it. I likewise wished to ascertain how 
far the emotions are expressed in the same manner by 
the different races of man. But owing to the length 
of the present work, I have thought it better to 
reserve my essay for separate publication. 

2 Prof. Hackel was the only importance, since the publica- 
author who, at the time when tion of the ‘Origin’; and this 
this work first appeared, had he did in a very able manner in 
discussed the subject of sexual his various works.

THE DESCENT OR ORIOIN OF MAN. 


CHAPTEE I. 

The Evidence of the Descent op Man from 
SOME Lower Form. 

Nature of the evidence hearing on the origin of man — Homologous 
structures in man and the lower animals — Miscellaneous points 
of correspondence — Development — Rudimentary structures, 
muscles, sense-organs, hair, bones, reproductive organs, &c. — 
The bearing of these three great classes of facts on the origin 
of man. 

He who wishes to decide whether man is the modified 
descendant of some pre-existing form, would probably 
first enquire whether man varies, however slightly, in 
bodily structure and in mental faculties ; and if so, 
whether the variations are transmitted to his offspring 
in accordance with the laws which prevail with the 
lower animals. Again, are the variations the result, 
as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, of the 
same general causes, and are they governed by the 
same general laws, as in the case of other organisms ; 
for instance, by correlation, the inherited effects of 
use and disuse, &c. ? Is man subject to similar

of reduplication of parts, &c., and does he display in 
any of his anomalies reversion to some former and 
ancient type of structure ? It might also naturally be 
enquired whether man, like so many other animals, 
has given rise to varieties and sub-races, differing 
but slightly from each other, or to races differing so 
much that they must be classed as doubtful species ? 
How are such races distributed over the world ; and 
how, when crossed, do they react on each other in the 
first and succeeding generations ? And so with many 
other points. 

The enquirer would next come to the important 
point, whether man tends to increase at so rapid a 
rate, as to lead to occasional severe struggles for 
existence; and consequently to beneficial variations, 
whether in body or mind, being preserved, and 
injurious ones eliminated. Do the races or species of 
men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and 
replace one another, so that some finally become 
extinct ? We shall see that all these questions, as 
indeed is obvious in respect to most of them, must be 
answered in the affirmative, in the same manner as 
with the lower animals. But the several considera- 
tions just referred to may be conveniently deferred for 
a time : and we will first see how far the bodily 
structure of man shows traces, more or less plain, of 
his descent from some lower form. In succeeding 
chapters the mental powers of man, in comparison 
with those of the lower animals, will be considered. 

The Bodily Structure of Man , — It is notorious that 
man is constructed on the same general type or model 
• as other mammals. All the bones in his skeleton can

be compared with corresponding bones in a monkey, 
bat, or seal. So it is with his muscles, nerves, blood- 
vessels and internal viscera. The brain, the most 
important of all the organs, follows the same law, as 
shewn by Huxley and other anatomists. Bischoff,^ 
who is a hostile witness, admits that every chief 
fissure and fold in the brain of man has its analogy in 
that of the orang ; but he adds that at no period of 
development do their brains perfectly agree ; nor 
could perfect agreement be expected, for otherwise 
their mental powers would have been the same. 
Vulpian^ remarks: “ Les differences reelles qui 
“ existent entre I’encephale de I’homme et celui des 
“ singes superieurs, sont bien minimes. II ne faut pas 
“se faire d’illusions a cet egard. ^L’homme est bien 
“ plus pres des singes anthropomorphes par les 
“ caracteres anatomiques de son cerveau que ceux-ci ne 
‘‘le sont non seulement des autres mammiferes, mais 
“ meme de certains quadrumanes, des guenons et des 
“ macaques.” But it would be superfluous here to 
give further details on the correspondence between 
man and the higher mammals in the structure of the 
brain and all other parts of the body. 

It may, however, be worth while to specify a few 
points, not directly or obviously connected with 
structure, by which this correspondence or relation- 
ship is well shewn.

to communicate to them, certain diseases, as hydro- 
phobia, variola, the glanders, syphilis, cholera, herpes, 
&c. ; ^ and this fact proves the close similarity ^ of 
their tissues and blood, both in minute structure and 
composition, far more plainly than does their com- 
parison under the best microscope, or by the aid of 
the best chemical analysis. Monkeys are liable to 
many of the same non-contagious diseases as we are ; 
thus Eengger,^ who carefully observed for a long time 
the Cebus Azarm in its native land, found it liable to 
catarrh, with the usual symptoms, and which, when 
often recurrent, led to consumption. These monkeys 
suffered also from apoplexy, inflammation of the 
bowels, and cataract in the eye. The younger ones 
when shedding their milk-teeth often died from fever. 
Medicines produced the same effect on them as on us. 
Many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, 
coffee, and spirituous liquors : they will also, as I have 
myself seen, smoke tobacco with pleasure.® Brehm 
asserts that the natives of north-eastern Africa catch

Oct. 1st, 1871, p. 472) what I 
have here said with much se- 
verity and contempt ; but as I 
do not use the term identity, I 
cannot see that I am greatly in 
error. There appears to me a 
sti'ong analogy between the

ducing the same result, or one

animals, and the testing of two 
distinct fluids by the same 
chemical reagent.

to some animals much lower in

forms me that he kept in 
Queensland, in Australia, three 
individuals of the Fhaseolarctus

having been taught in any way, 
they acquired a strong taste for 
rum, and for smoking tobacco.

the wild baboons by exposing vessels with strong beer, 
by which they are made drunk. He has seen some of 
these animals, which he kept in confinement, in this 
state ; and he gives a laughable account of their 
behaviour and strange grimaces. On the following 
morning they were very cross and dismal ; they held 
their aching heads with both hands, and wore a most 
pitiable expression : when beer or wine was offered 
them, they turned away with disgust, but relished the 
juice of lemons.’ An American monkey, an Ateles, 
after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it 
again, and thus was wiser than many men. These 
trifling facts prove how similar the nerves of taste must 
be in monkeys and man, and how similarly their whole 
nervous system is afi“ected. 

Man is infested with internal parasites, sometimes 
causing fatal effects ; and is plagued by external 
parasites, all of which belong to the same genera or 
families as those infesting other mammals, and in the 
case of scabies to the same species.® Man is subject, 
like other mammals, birds, and even insects,® to that 
mysterious law, which causes certain normal processes, 
such as gestation, as well as the maturation and 
duration of various diseases, to follow lunar periods.

his limbs, especially during an early embryonic period, 
occasionally possess some power of regeneration, as in 
the lowest animals.^® 

The whole process of that most important function, 
the reproduction cf the species, is strikingly the same 
in all mammals, from the first act of courtship by the 
male,“ to the birth and nurturing of the young. 
Monkeys are born in almost as helpless a condition as 
our own infants; and in certain genera the young 
differ fully as much in appearance from the adults, as 
do our children from their full-grown parents. It 
has been urged by some writers, as an important 
distinction, that with man the young arrive at 
maturity at a much later age than with any other 
animal : but if we look to the races of mankind which 
inhabit tropical countries the difference is not great, 
for the orang is believed not to be adult till the age of 
from ten to fifteen years. Man differs from woman

on this head in my ‘ Variation 
of Animals and Plants under

in size, bodily strength, hairiness, &c., as well as in 
mind, in the same manner as do the two sexes of many 
mammals. So that the correspondence in general 
structure, in the minute structure of the tissues, in 
chemical composition and in constitution, between 
man and the higher animals, especially the anthropo- 
morphous apes, is extremely close. 

Embryonic Development . — Man is developed from an 
ovule, about the 125th of an inch in diameter, which 
differs in no respect from the ovules of other animals. 
The embryo itself at a very early period can hardly be 
distinguished from that of other members of the 
vertebrate kingdom. At this period the arteries run 
in arch-like branches, as if to carry the blood to 
branchiae which are not present in the higher verte- 
brata, though the slits on the sides of the neck still 
remain (/, g, fig. 1), marking their former position. 
At a somewhat later period, when the extremities are 
developed, “ the feet of lizards and mammals,’' as the 
illustrious Yon Baer remarks, “ the wings and feet of 
“ birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all 
“ arise from the same fundamental form.” It is, says 
Prof. Huxley, “quite in the later stages of develop- 
“ ment that the young human being presents marked 
“ differences from the young ape, while the latter 
“ departs as much from the dog in its developments, as 
“ the man does. Startling as this last assertion may 
“ appear to be, it is demonstrably true.” 

As some of my readers may never have seen a draw- 
ing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another 
of a dog, at about the same early stage of develop-

ment, carefully copied from two works of undoubted 
accuracy.^*' 

After the foregoing statements made by such high 
authorities, it would be superfluous on my part to give 
a number of borrowed details, shewing that the embryo 
of man closely resembles that of other mammals. It 
may, however, be added, that the human embryo like- 
wise resembles certain low forms when adult in various 
points of structure. For instance, the heart at first 
exists as a simple pulsating vessel ; the excreta are 
voided through a cloacal passage ; and the os coccyx 
projects like a true tail, ‘‘ extending considerably 
“ beyond the rudimentary legs.”^® In the embryos of 
all air-breathing vertebrates, certain glands, called the 
corpora Wolffiana, correspond with, and act like the 
kidneys of mature fishes.^^ Even at a later embryonic 
period, some striking resemblances between man and 
the lower animals may be observed. Bischoff says 
that the convolutions of the brain in a human foetus 


at the end of the seventh month reach about the same 
stage of development as in a baboon when adult.”^®

“ forms tlie fulcrum when standing or walking, is 
“perhaps the most characteristic peculiarity in the 
“ human structure ; ” hut in an embryo, about an inch 
in length. Prof. Wyman^° found “ that the great toe 
“ was shorter than the others ; and, instead of being 
“ parallel to them, projected at an angle from the side 
“ of the foot, thus corresponding with the permanent 
“ condition of this part in the quadrumana.” I will 
conclude with a quotation from Huxley,^^ who after 
asking, does man originate in a different way from a 
dog, bird, frog or fish ? says, “ the reply is not doubt- 
“ful for a moment; without question, the mode of 
“ origin, and the early stages of the development of man, 
“ are identical with those of the animals immediately 
“ below him in the scale : without a doubt in these 
“ respects, he is far nearer to apes than the apes are to 
“ the dog.” 

Rudiments . — This subject, though not intrinsically 
more important than the two last, will for several 
reasons be treated here more fully.^^ Not one of the 
higher animals can be named which does not bear some 
part in a rudimentary condition ; and man forms no 
exception to the rule. Kudimentary organs must be 
distinguished from those that are nascent ; though in 
some cases the distinction is not easy. The former are 
either absolutely useless, such as the mammae of male

quadrupeds, or the incisor teeth of ruminants which 
never cut through the gums; or they are of such 
slight service to their present possessors, that we can 
hardly suppose that they were developed under the 
conditions which now exist. Organs in this latter 
state are not strictly rudimentary, but they are* tending 
in this direction. Nascent organs, on the other hand, 
though not fully developed, are of high service to 
their possessors, and are capable of further develop- 
ment. Eudimentary organs are eminently variable ; 
and this is partly intelligible, as they are useless, or 
nearly useless, and consequently are no longer sub- 
jected to natural selection. They often become wholly 
suppressed. When this occurs, they are nevertheless 
liable to occasional reappearance through reversion — 
a circumstance well worthy of attention. 

The chief agents in causing organs to become rudi- 
mentary seem to have been disuse at that period of 
life when the organ is chiefly used (and this is generally 
during maturity), and also inheritance at a corres- 
ponding period of life. The term “ disuse ” does not 
relate merely to the lessened action of muscles, but 
includes a diminished flow of blood to a part or organ, 
from being subjected to fewer alternations of pressure, 
or from becoming in any way less habitually active. 
Eudiments, however, may occur in one sex of those 
parts which are normally present in the other sex ; 
and such rudiments, as we shall hereafter see, have 
often originated in a way distinct from those here 
referred to. In some cases, organs have been reduced 
by means of natural selection, from having become 
injurious to the species under changed habits of life. 
The process of reduction is probably often aided 


Chap. I. 


RUDIMENTS. 


17 


through the two principles of compensation and 
economy of growth ; but the later stages of reduction, 
after disuse has done all that can fairly be attributed 
to it, and when the saving to be effected by the 
economy of growth would be very small,^^ are difficult 
to understand. The final and complete suppression of 
a part, already useless and much reduced in size, in 
which case neither compensation nor economy can 
come into play, is perhaps intelligible by the aid of 
the hypothesis of pangenesis. But as the whole sub- 
ject of rudimentary organs has been discussed and 
illustrated in my former works, I need here say no 
more on this head. 


Eudiments of various muscles have been observed in • 
many parts of the human body ; and not a few 
muscles, which are regularly present in some T the 
lower animals can occasionally be detected in man in 
a greatly reduced condition. Every one must have 
noticed the power which many animals, especially horses, 
possess of moving or twitching their skin ; and this is 
effected by the 'panniculus carnosus. Eemnants of this 
• muscle in an efficient state are found in various parts 
of our bodies ; for instance, the muscle on the fore- 
head, by which the eyebrows are raised. The platysma 
myoicteSy which is well developed on the, neck, belongs

time to time in a more or less

to this system. Prof. Turner, of Edinburgh, has 
occasionally detected, as he informs me, muscular 
fasciculi in five different situations, namely in the 
axillae, near the scapulae, &c., all of which must be 
referred to the system of the panniculus. He has 
also shewn^® that the musculus sternalis or sternalis 
hrutorum, which is not an extension of the rectus 
abdominalis, but is closely allied to the panniculus^ 
occurred in the proportion of about three per cent, in 
upwards of 600 bodies: he adds, that this muscle 
affords “ an excellent illustration of the statement 
“ that occasional and rudimentary structures are 
“ especially liable to variation in arrangement.” 

Some few persons have the power of contracting the 
superficial muscles on their scalps ; and these muscles 
are in a variable and partially rudimentary condition. 
M. A. de Candolle has communicated to me a curious 
instance of the long-continued persistence or inheri- 
tance of this power, as well as of its unusual develop- 
ment. He knows a family, in which one member, the 
present head of the family, could, when a youth, pitch ^ 
several heavy books from his head by the movement of 
the scalp alone ; and he won wagers by performing this 
feat. His father, uncle, grandfather, and his three 
children possess the same power to the same unusual 
degree. This family became divided eight generations 
ago into two branches ; so that the head of the above- 
mentioned branch is cousin in the seventh degree to 
the head of the other branch. This distant cousin 
resides in another part of France ; and on being asked 
whether he possessed the same faculty, immediately 
exhibited his power. This case offers a good illustra-

tion how persistent may be the transmission of an 
absolutely useless faculty, probably derived from our 
remote semi- human progenitors ; since many monkeys 
have, and frequently use the power, of largely moving 
their scalps up and down.^^ 

The extrinsic muscles which serve to move the 
external ear, and the intrinsic muscles which move the 
different parts, are in a rudimentary condition in man, 
and they all belong to the system of the 'panniculus ; they 
are also variable in development, or at least in function. 
I have seen one man who could draw the whole ear 
forwards ; other men can draw it upwards ; another 
who could draw it backwards and from what one of 
these persons told me, it is probable that most of us, 
by often touching our ears, and thus directing our 
attention towards them, could recover some power of 
movement by repeated trials. The power of erecting 
and directing the shell of the ears to the various 
points of the compass, is no doubt of the highest 
service to many animals, as they thus perceive the 
direction of danger; but I have never heard, on 
sufficient evidence, of a man who possessed this power, 
the one which might be of use to him. The whole 
external shell may be considered a rudiment, to- 
gether with the various folds and prominences (helix 
and anti-helix, tragus and anti-tragus, &c.) which in 
the lower animals strengthen and support the ear 
when erect, without adding much to its weight. Some 
authors, however, suppose that the cartilage of the 
shell serves to transmit vibrations to the acoustic

nerve ; but Mr. Toynbee/® after collecting all the 
known evidence on this head, concludes that the 
external shell is of no distinct use. The ears of the 
chimpanzee and orang are curiously like those of 
man, and the proper muscles are likewise hut very 
slightly developed.^® I am also assured by the keepers 
in the Zoological Gardens that these animals never 
move or erect their ears ; so that they are in an equally 
rudimentary condition with those of man, as far as 
function is concerned. Why these animals, as well as 
the progenitors of man, should have lost the power of 
erecting their ears, we cannot say. It may be, though 
I am not satisfied with this view, that owing to their 
arboreal habits and great strength they were but little 
exposed to danger, and so during a lengthened period 
moved their ears but little, and thus gradually lost 
the power of moving them. This would be a parallel 
case with that of those large and heavy birds, which, 
from inhabiting oceanic islands, have not been exposed 
to the attacks of beasts of prey, and have consequently 
lost the power of using their wings for fiight. The 
inability to move the ears in man and several apes is, 
however, partly compensated by the freedom with 
which they can move the head in a horizontal plane, so 
as to catch sounds from all directions. It has been 
asserted that the ear of’ man alone possesses a lobule ; 
but ‘‘ a rudiment of it is found in the gorilla and, as

I hear from Prof. Preyer, it is not rarely absent in the 
negro. 

The celebrated sculptor, Mr. Woolner, informs me of 
one little peculiarity in the external ear, which he has 
often observed both in men and women, and of which 
he perceived the full significance. His attention was 
first called to the subject whilst at work on his figure 
of Puck, to which he had given pointed ears. He was 
thus led to examine the ears of various monkeys, and 
subsequently more carefully 
those of man. The peculiarity 
consists in a little blunt point, 
projecting from the inwardly 
folded margin, or helix. When 
present, it is developed at birth, 
and, according to Prof. Ludwig 
Meyer, more frequently in man 
than in woman. Mr. Woolner 
made an exact model of one such 
case, and sent me the accom- 
panying drawing. (Fig- 2.) 

These points not only project 
inwards towards the centre of the ear, but often a little 
outwards from its plane, so as to be visible when the 
head is viewed from directly in front or behind. They 
are variable in size, and somewhat in position, standing 
either a little higher or lower ; and they sometimes 
occur on one ear and not on the other. They are not 
confined to mankind, for I observed a case in one of the 
spider- monkeys {Ateles heelzebuth) in our Zoological 
Gardens ; and Mr. E. Eay Lankester informs me of 
another case in a chimpanzee in the gardens at Hamburg. 
The helix obviously consists of the extreme margin

of the ear folded inwards ; and this folding appears 
to be in some manner connected with the whole ex- 
ternal ear being permanently pressed backwards. In

baboons and some species of macacus,^^ the upper portion 
of the ear is slightly pointed, and the margin is not at all 
folded inwards ; but if the margin were to be thus folded, 
a slight point would necessarily project inwards towards 
the centre, and probably a little outwards from the 
plane of the ear ; and this I believe to be their origin in 
many cases. On the other hand. Prof. L. Meyer, in an 
able paper recently published, maintains that the 
whole case is one of mere variability ; and that the 
projections are not real ones, but are due to the 
internal cartilage on each side of the points not having 
been fully developed. I am quite ready to admit that 
this is the correct explanation in many instances, as in 
those figured by Prof. Meyer, in which there are 
several minute points, or the whole margin is sinuous. 
I have myself seen, through the kindness of Dr. L. 
Down, the ear of a microcephalous idiot, on which there 
is a projection on the outside of the helix, and not on 
the inward folded edge, so that this point can have no 
relation to a former apex of the ear. Nevertheless in 
some cases, my original view, that the points are 
vestiges of the tips of formerly erect and pointed ears, 
still seems to me probable. I think so from the 
frequency of their occurrence, and from the general 
correspondence in position with that of the tip of a

pointed ear. In one case, of which a photograph has 
been sent me, the projection is so large, that supposing, 
in accordance with Prof. Meyer’s view, the ear to be 
made perfect by the equal development of the cartilage 
throughout the whole extent of the margin, it would 
have covered fully one-third of the whole ear. Two 
cases have been communicated to me, one in North 
America, and the other in England, in which the upper 
margin is not at all folded inwards, hut is pointed, so 
that it closely resembles the pointed ear of an ordinary 
quadruped in outline. In one of these cases, which 
was that of a young child, the father compared the ear 
with the drawing which I have given^^ of the ear of a 
monkey, the Cynopithecus niger, and says that their 
outlines are closely similar. If, in these two cases, the 
margin had been folded inwards in the normal manner, 
an inward projection must have been formed. I may 
add that in two other cases the outline still remains 
somewhat pointed, although the margin of the upper 
part of the ear is normally folded inwards — in one of 
them, however, very narrowly. The following woodcut 
(No. 3) is an accurate copy of a photograph of the 
foetus of an orang (kindly sent me by Dr. Nitsche), in 
which it may be seen how different the pointed outline 
of the ear is at this period from its adult condition, 
when it bears a close general resemblance to that of 
man. It is evident that the folding over of the tip of 
such an ear, unless it changed greatly during its 
further development, would give rise to a point pro- 
jecting inwards. On the whole, it still seems to me 
probable that the points in question are in some cases, 
both in man and apes, vestiges of a former condition.

the greater number of mammals — to some, as the 
ruminants, in warning them of danger ; to others, as 
the carnivora, in finding their prey ; to others, again, 
as the wild boar, for both purposes combined. But 
the sense of smell is of extremely slight service, if 
any, even to the dark coloured races of men, in whom 
it is much more highly developed than in the white 
and civilised races.^® Nevertheless it does not warn 


them of danger, nor guide them to their food ; nor 
does it prevent the Esquimaux from sleeping in the 
most fetid atmosphere, nor many savages from eating 
half-putrid meat. In Europeans the power differs 
greatly in different individuals, as I am assured by an 
eminent naturalist who possesses this sense highly 
developed, and who has attended to the subject. Those 
who believe in the principle of gradual evolution, will 
not readily admit that the sense of smell in its present 
state was originally acquired by man, as he now exists. 
He inherits the power in an enfeebled and so far rudi- 
mentary condition, from some early progenitor, to 
whom it was highly serviceable, and by whom it was 
continually used. In those animals which have this 
sense highly developed, such as dogs and horses, the 
recollection of persons and of places is strongly 


The account given by- 
Humboldt of the power of smell 
possessed by the natives of 
South America is well known, 
and has been confirmed by 
others. M. Houzeau (‘I^tudes 
sur les Facultes Mentales,’ &c., 
tom. i. 1872, p. 91) asserts that 
he repeatedly made experiments, 
and proved that Negroes and 
ludians could recognise persons 
in the dark by their odour. Dr. 
W. Ogle has made some curious 


observations on the connection 
between the power of smell and 
the colouring matter of the 
mucous membrane of the ol- 
factory region, as well as of the 
skin of the body. I have, there- 
fore, spoken in the text of the 
dark-coloured races having a 
finer sense of smell than the 
white races. See his paper, 
‘ Medico - Chirurgical ITansac- 
tions,’ London, vol. liii., 1870, p. 
276.

associated with their odour ; and we can thus perhaps 
understand how it is, as Dr. Maudsley has truly 
remarked, that the sense of smell in man “ is 
“ singularly effectiye in recalling vividly the ideas and 
“ images of forgotten scenes and places.” 

Man differs conspicuously from all the other 
Primates in being almost naked. But a few short 
straggling hairs are found over the greater part of the 
body in the man, and fine down on that of the woman. 
The different races differ much in hairiness ; and in 
the individuals of the same race the hairs are highly 
variable, not only in abundance, but likewise in 
position : thus in some Europeans the shoulders are 
quite naked, whilst in others they bear thick tufts of 
hair.^® There can be little doubt that the hairs thus 
scattered over the body are the rudiments of the uniform 
hairy coat of the lower animals. This view is rendered 
all the more probable, as it is known that fine, short, and 
pale-coloured hairs on the limbs and other parts of the 
body, occasionally become developed into “ thickset, 
long, and rather coarse dark hairs,” when abnormally 
nourished near old-standing inflamed surfaces.^® 

I am informed by Sir James Paget that often several 
members of a family have a few hairs in their eyebrows 
much longer than the others ; so that even this slight 
peculiarity seems to be inherited. These hairs, too, 
seem to have their representatives ; for in the chim- 
panzee, and in certain species of Macacus, there are

scattered hairs of considerable length rising from the 
naked skin above the eyes, and corresponding to our 
eyebrows ; similar long hairs project from the hairy 
covering of the superciliary ridges in some baboons. 

The fine wool-like hair, or so-called lanugo, with 
which the human foetus during the sixth month is 
thickly covered, offers a more curious case. It is first 
developed, during the fifth month, on the eyebrows 
and face, and especially round the mouth, where it is 
much longer than that on the head. A moustache of 
this kind was observed by Eschricht^® on a female 
foetus ; but this is not so surprising a circumstance as 
it may at first appear, for the two sexes generally 
resemble each other in all external characters during 
an early period of growth. The direction and arrange- 
ment of the hairs on all parts of the foetal body are 
the same as in the adult, but are subject to much 
variability. The whole surface, including even the 
forehead and ears, is thus thickly clothed ; but it is 
a significant fact that the palms of the hands and the 
soles of the feet are quite naked, like the inferior 
surfaces of all four extremities in most of the lower 
animals. As this can hardly be an accidental 
coincidence, the woolly covering of the foetus probably 
represents the first permanent coat of hair in those 
mammals which are horn hairy. Three or four cases 
have been recorded of persons born with their whole 
bodies and faces thickly covered with fine long hairs ; 
and this strange condition is strongly inherited, and is 
correlated with an abnormal condition of the teeth.^^

Prof. Alex. Brandt informs me tliat he has compared 
the hair from the face of a man thus characterised, 
aged thirty-five, with the lanugo of a foetus, and finds 
it quite similar in texture ; therefore, as he remarks, 
the case may be attributed to an arrest of development 
in the hair, together with its continued growth. 
Many delicate children, as I have been assured by a 
surgeon to a hospital for children, have their backs 
covered by rather long silky hairs ; and such cases 
probably come under the same head. 

It appears as if the posterior molar or wisdom-teeth 
were tending to become rudimentary in the more 
civilised races of man. These teeth are rather smaller 
than the other molars, as is likewise the case with the 
corresponding teeth in the chimpanzee and orang ; 
and they have only two separate fangs. They do not 
cut through the gums till about the seventeenth year, 
and I have been assured that they are much more 
liable to decay, and are earlier lost than the other 
teeth ; but this is denied by some eminent dentists. 
They are also much more liable to vary, both in 
structure, and in the period of their development, than 
the other teeth.'*^ In the Melanian races, on the other 
hand, the wisdom-teeth are usually furnished with 
three separate fangs, and are generally sound; they 
also difier from the other molars in size, less than in 
the Caucasian races.^^ Prof. Schaaffhausen accounts 


and son, born in Russia, with 
these peculiarities. I have re- 
ceived drawings of both from 
Paris.

for this difference between the races by ‘‘ the posterior 
dental portion of the jaw being always shortened ” in 
those that are civilised/^ and this shortening may, I 
presume, be attributed to civilised men habitually 
feeding on soft, cooked food, and thus using their jaws 
less. I am informed by Mr. Brace that it is becoming 
quite a common practice in the United States to 
remove some of the molar teeth of children, as the jaw 
does not grow large enough for the perfect develop- 
ment of the normal number.^” 

With respect to the alimentary canal, I have met 
with an account of only a single rudiment, namely the 
vermiform appendage of the csecum. The caecum is a 
branch or diverticulum of the intestine, ending in a 
cul-de-sac, and is extremely long in many of the lower 
vegetable-feeding mammals. In the marsupial koala 
it is actually more than thrice as long as the whole 
body.'^® It is sometimes produced into a long gradually- 
tapering point, and is sometimes constricted in parts. 
It appears as if, in consequence of changed diet or 
habits, the caecum had become much shortened in 
various animals, the vermiform appendage being left 
as a rudiment of the shortened part. That this 
appendage is a rudiment, we may infer from its small 
size, and from the evidence which Prof. Canestrini^^ 
has collected of its variability in man. It is occasion-

molar teeth in the different

they are on the road towards 
atrophy or elimination.

ally quite absent, or again is largely developed. The 
passage is sometimes completely closed for half or 
two-thirds of its length, with the terminal part con- 
sisting of a flattened solid expansion. In the orang 
this appendage is long and convoluted : in man it 
arises from the end of the short caecum, and is 
commonly from four to five inches in length, being 
only about the third of an inch in diameter. Not only 
is it useless, but it is sometimes the cause of death, of 
which fact I have lately heard ^two instances : this is 
due to small hard bodies, such as seeds, entering the 
passage, and causing inflammation.'^® 

In some of the lower Quadrumana, in the Lemuridae 
and Carnivora, as well as in many marsupials, there is 
a passage near the lower end of the humerus, called 
the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great 
nerve of the fore limb and often the great artery pass. 
Now in the humerus of man, there is generally a trace 
of this passage, which is sometimes fairly well deve- 
loped, being formed by a depending hook-like process 
of bone, completed by a band of ligament. Dr. 
Struthers,^® who has closely attended to the subject, 
has now shewn that this peculiarity is sometimes 
inherited, as it has occurred in a father, and in no less

have both remarked on the 
singular fact of this rudiment 
sometimes causing death.

than four out of his seven children. When present, 
the great nerve invariably passes through it ; and this 
clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment 
of the supra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. 
Prof. Turner estimates, as he informs me, that it 
occurs in about one per cent, of recent skeletons. But 
if the occasional development of this structure in man 
is, as seems probable, due to reversion, it is a return 
to a very ancient state of things, because in the higher 
Quadrumana it is absent. 

There is another foramen or perforation in the 
humerus, occasionally present in man, which may be 
called the inter-condyloid. This occurs, but not 
constantly, in various anthropoid and other apes,^° 
and likewise in many of the lower animals. It is 
remarkable that this perforation seems to have been 
present in man much more frequently during ancient 
times than recently. Mr. Busk^^ has collected the 
follovring evidence on this head : Prof. Broca “ noticed 
“ the perforation in four and a half per cent, of the 
“ arm-bones collected in the ‘ Cimetiere du Sud,’ at 
“ Paris ; and in the Grrotto of Orrony, the contents of 
“ which are referred to the Bronze period, as many as 
“ eight humeri out of thirty-two were perforated ; but 
“ this extraordinary proportion, he thinks, might be 
“ due to the cavern having been a sort of ‘ family 
“ vault.’ Again, M. Dupont found thirty per cent.

“ of perforated bones in the caves of the Valley of

“ Pruner-Bey found twenty-six per cent, in the same 
“ condition in bones from Yaureal. Nor should it 
“ be left unnoticed that M. Pruner-Bey states that 
'‘this condition is common in Guanche skeletons.” 
It is an interesting fact that ancient races, in 
this and several other cases, more frequently present 
structures which resemble those of the lower animals 
than do the modern. One chief cause seems to be 
that the ancient races stand somewhat nearer in 
the long line of descent to their remote animal-like 
progenitors. 

In man, the os coccyx, together with certain other 
vertebrae hereafter to be described, though function- 
less as a tail, plainly represent this part in other 
vertebrate animals. At an early embryonic period it 
is free, and projects beyond the lower extremities ; as 
may be seen in the drawing (Fig. 1.) of a human 
embryo. Even after birth it has been known, in 
certain rare and anomalous cases,®^ to form a small 
external rudiment of a tail. The os coccyx is short, 
usually including only four vertebrae, all anchylosed 
together : and these are in a rudimentary condition, 
for they consist, with the exception of the basal one,

of the centrum alone.®^ They are furnished with some 
small muscles ; one of which, as I am informed by Prof. 
Tamer, has been expressly described by Theile as a 
rudimentary repetition of the extensor of the tail, a 
muscle which is so largely developed in many mammals. 

The spinal cord in man extends only as far down- 
wards as the last dorsal or first lumbar vertebra ; but 
a thread-like structure (the Jllum terminale) runs down 
the axis of the sacral part of the spinal canal, and even 
along the back of the coccygeal bones. The upper 
part of this filament, as Prof. Turner informs me, is 
undoubtedly homologous with the spinal cord ; but the 
lower part apparently consists merely of the pia mater ^ 
or vascular investing membrane. Even in this case 
the os coccyx may be said to possess a vestige of so 
important a structure as the spinal cord, though no 
longer enclosed within a bony canal. The following 
fact, for which I am also indebted to Prof. Turner, 
shews how closely the os coccyx corresponds with the 
true tail in the lower animals : Luschka has recently 
discovered at the extremity of the coccygeal bones a 
very peculiar convoluted body, which is continuous 
with the middle sacral artery ; and this discovery led 
Krause and Meyer to examine the tail of a monkey 
(Macacus), and of a cat, in both of which they found 
a similarly convoluted body, though not at the ex- 
tremity. 

The reproductive system offers various rudimentary 
structures ; but these differ in one important respect 
from the foregoing cases. Here we are not concerned 
with the vestige of a part which does not belong to 
the species in an efficient state, but with a part 
“ Owen, ‘ On the Nature of Limbs,’ 1849, p. 114.

efficient in the one sex, and represented in the other 
by a mere rudiment. Nevertheless, the occurrence of 
such rudiments is as difficult to explain, on the belief 
of the separate creation of each species, as in the fore- 
' going cases. Hereafter I shall have to recur to these 
rudiments, and shall shew that their presence generally 
depends merely on inheritance, that is, on parts 
acquired by one sex having been partially transmitted 
to the other. I will in this place only give some 
instances of such rudiments. It is well known that 
in the males of all mammals, including man, rudi- 
mentary mammae exist. These in several instances 
have become well developed, and have yielded a copious 
supply of milk. Their essential identity in the two 
sexes is likewise shewn by their occasional sympathetic 
enlargement in both during an attack of the measles. 
The vesicula prostatica, which has been observed in 
many male mammals, is now universally acknowledged 
to he the homologue of the female uterus, together 
with the connected passage. It is impossible to read 
Leuckart’s able description of this organ, and his 
reasoning, without admitting the justness of his 
conclusion. This is especially clear in the case of 
those mammals in which the true female uterus 
bifurcates, for in the males of these the vesicula like- 
wise hifurcates.^^ Some other rudimentary structures 
belonging to the reproductive system might have been 
here adduced.^®

The bearing of the three great classes of facts now 
given is unmistakeable. But it would be superfluous 
fully to recapitulate the line of argument given in 
detail in my ‘ Origin of Species.* The homological 
construction of the whole frame in the members of the 
same class is intelligible, if we admit their descent 
from a common progenitor, together with their sub- 
sequent adaptation to diversified conditions. On any 
other view, the similarity of pattern between the hand 
of a man or monkey, the foot of a horse, the flipper of 
a seal, the wing of a bat, &c., is utterly inexplicable.®® 
It is no scientific explanation to assert that they have 
all been formed on the same ideal plan. With respect 
to development, we can clearly understand, on the 
principle of variations supervening at a rather late 


“ Prof. Bianconi, in a recently 
published work, illustrated by 
admirable engravings (‘ La 
Theorie Darwinienne et la crea- 
tion dite independante,’ 1874), 
endeavours to show that homo- 
logical structures, in the above 
and other cases, can be fully 
explained on mechanical prin- 
ciples, in accordance with their 
uses. No one has shown so 
well, how admirably such struc- 
tures are adapted for their final 
purpose ; and this adaptation 
can, as I believe, be explained 
through natural selection. In 
considering the wing of a bat, 
he brings forward (p. 218) what 
appears to me (to use Auguste 
Comte’s words) a mere meta- 
physical principle, namely, the 
preservation “ in its integrity of 
“ the mammalian nature of the 
“ animal.” In only a few cases 


does he discuss rudiments, and 
then only those parts which are 
partially rudimentary, such as 
the little hoofs of the pig and 
ox, which do not touch the 
ground ; these he shews clearly 
to be of service to the animal. 
It is unfortunate that he did not 
consider such cases as the 
mmute teeth, which never cut 
through the jaw in the ox, or 
the mammse of male quadrupeds, 
or the wings of certain beetles, 
existing under the soldered 
wing-covers, or the vestiges of 
the pistil and stamens in various 
flowers, and many other such 
cases. Although I greatly 
admire Prof. Bianconi’s work, 
yet the belief now held by most 
naturalists seems to me left 
imshaken, that homological 
structures are inexplicahle on 
the principle of mere adaptation.

embryonic period, and being inherited at a corre- 
sponding period, how it is that the embryos of wonder- 
fully different forms should still retain, more or less 
perfectly, the structure of their common progenitor. 
No other explanation has ever been given of the 
marvellous fact that the embryos of a man, dog, seal, 
bat, reptile, &c., can at first hardly be distinguished 
from each other. In order to understand the existence 
of rudimentary organs, we have only to suppose that 
a former progenitor possessed the parts in question in 
a perfect state, and that under changed habits of life 
they became greatly reduced, either from simple 
disuse, or through the natural selection of those 
individuals which were least encumbered with a 
superfluous part, aided by the other means previously 
indicated. 

Thus we can understand how it has come to pass that 
man and all other vertebrate animals have been con- 
structed on the same general model, why they pass 
through the same early stages of development, and 
why they retain certain rudiments in common. Con- 
sequently we ought frankly to admit their community 
of descent ; to take any other view, is to admit that 
our own structure, and that of all the animals around 
us, is a mere snare laid to entrap our judgment. This 
conclusion is greatly strengthened, if we look to the 
members of the whole animal series, and consider the 
evidence derived from their affinities or classification, 
their geographical distribution and geological suc- 
cession. It is only our natural prejudice, and that 
arrogance which made our forefathers declare that 
they were descended from demi-gods, which leads us

to demur to this conclusion. But the time will before 
long come, when it will be thought wonderful that 
naturalists, who were well acquainted with the com- 
parative structure and development of man, and other 
mammals, should have believed that each was the 
work of a separate act of creation.

It is manifest that man is now subject to much 
variability. No two individuals of the same race are 
quite alike. We may compare millions of faces, and 
each will be distinct. There is an equally great 
amount of diversity in the proportions and dimensions 
of the various parts of the body ; the length of the 
legs being one of the most variable points.^ Although 
in some quarters of the world an elongated skull, and 
in other quarters a short skull prevails, yet there is 
great diversity of shape even within the limits of the 
same race, as with the aborigines of America and 
South Australia — the latter a race probably as pure 
“ and homogeneous in blood, customs, and language as

‘‘any in existence” — and even with the inhabitants 
of so confined an area as the Sandwich Islands.^ An 
eminent dentist assures me that there is nearly as 
much diversity in the teeth as in the features. The 
chief arteries so frequently run in abnormal courses, 
that it has been found useful for surgical purposes to 
calculate from 1040 corpses how often each course 
prevails.^ The muscles are eminently variable : thus 
those of the foot were found by* Prof. Turner ^ not to 
be strictly alike in any two out of fifty bodies ; and in 
some the deviations were considerable. He adds, that 
the power of performing the appropriate movements 
must have been modified in accordance with the 
several deviations. Mr. J. Wood has recorded® the 
occurrence of 295 muscular variations in thirty-six 
subjects, and in another set of the same number no 
less than 558 variations, those occurring on both sides 
of the body being only reckoned as one. In the last 
set, not one body out of the thirty-six was “ found 
“ totally wanting in departures from the standard 
“descriptions of the muscular system given in ana- 
“tomical text books.” A single body presented the 
extraordinary number of twenty-five distinct ab- 
normalities. The same muscle sometimes varies in 
many ways: thus Prof. Macalister describes® no less

than twenty distinct variations in the 'palmaris ac- 
cessorius. 

The famous old anatomist, Wolff,’ insists that the 
internal viscera are more variable than the external 
parts : Nulla particula est quw non aliter et aliter in 
aliis se habeat hominibus. He has even written a 
treatise on the choice of typical examples of the 
viscera for representation. A discussion on the beau- 
ideal of the liver, lungs, kidneys, &c., as of the human 
face divine, sounds strange in our ears. 

The variability or diversity of the mental faculties 
in men of the same race, not to mention the greater 
differences between the men of distinct races, is so 
notorious that not a word need here be said. So it is 
with the lower animals. All who have had charge of 
menageries admit this fact, and we see it plainly 
in our dogs and other domestic animals. Brehm 

especially insists that each individual monkey of those 
which he kept tame in Africa had its own peculiar 
disposition and temper: he mentions one baboon 
remarkable for its high intelligence ; and the keepers 
in the Zoological Gardens pointed out to me a monkey, 
belonging to the New World division, equally remark- 
able for intelligence. Eengger, also, insists on the 
diversity in the various mental characters of the 
monkeys of the same species which he kept in 
Paraguay; and this diversity, as he adds, is partly 
innate, and partly the result of the manner in which 
they have been treated or educated.®

Inheritance, that I need here add hardly anything. A 
greater number of facts have been collected with respect 
to the transmission of the most trifling, as well as of 
the most important characters in man, than in any of 
the lower animals; though the facts are copious 
enough with respect to the latter. So in regard to 
mental qualities, their transmission is manifest in our 
dogs, horses, and other domestic animals. Besides 
special tastes and habits, general intelligence, courage, 
bad and good temper, &c., are certainly transmitted. 
With man we see similar facts in almost every family ; 
and we now know, through the admirable labours of Mr. 
Ga]ton,^° that genius which implies a wonderfully com- 
plex combination of high faculties, tends to be in- 
herited ; and, on the other hand, it is too certain that 
insanity and deteriorated mental powers likewise run 
in families. 

With respect to the causes of variability, we are in 
all cases very ignorant ; but we can see that in man as 
in the lower animals, they stand in some relation to 
the conditions to which each species has been exposed, 
during several generations. Domesticated animals 
vary more than those in a state of nature ; and this 
is apparently due to the diversified and changing 
nature of the conditions to which they have been 
subjected. In this respect the different races of man 
resemble domesticated animals, and so do the in- 
dividuals of the same race, when inhabiting a very 
wide area, like that of America. We see the influence 
of diversified conditions in the more civilised nations ;

and following different occupations, present a greater 
range of character than do the members of barbarous 
nations. But the uniformity of savages has often 
been exaggerated, and in some cases can hardly be 
said to exist.“ It is, nevertheless, an error to speak 
of man, even if we look only to the conditions to 
which he has been exposed, as ‘‘far more domesti- 
“ cated ” than any other animal. Some savage races, 
such as the Australians, are not exposed to more 
diversified conditions than are many species which 
have a wide range. In another and much more 
important respect, man differs widely from any strictly 
domesticated animal ; for his breeding has never long 
been controlled, either by methodical or unconscious 
selection. No race or body of men has been so com- 
pletely subjugated by other men, as that certain 
individuals should be preserved, and thus unconsciously 
selected, from somehow excelling in utility to their 
masters. Nor have certain male and female individuals 
been intentionally picked out and matched, except in 
the well-known case of the Prussian grenadiers; and 
in this case man obeyed, as might have been expected, 
the law of methodical selection ; for it is asserted that 
many tall men were reared in the villages inhabited 
by the grenadiers and their tall wives. In Sparta, 
also, a form of selection was followed, for it was 
enacted that all children should be examined shortly

Naturalist on the Amazons,’

after birth ; the well-formed and vigorous being 
preserved, the others left to perish. 

If we consider all the races of man as forming a 
single species, his range is enormous; but some 
separate races, as the Americans and Polynesians, 
have very wide ranges. It is a well-known law that 
widely-ranging species are much more variable than 
species with restricted ranges ; and the variability of * 
man may with more truth be compared with that of 
widely-ranging species, than with that of domesticated 
animals. 

Not only does variability appear to be induced in 
man and the lower animals by the same general causes, 
but in both the same parts of the body are affected in 
a closely analogous manner. This has been proved in 


“ Mitford’s ‘ History of 
Greece,’ vol. i. p. 282. It 
appears also from a passage in 
Xenophon’s ‘ Memorabilia,’ B. 
ii. 4 (to which my attention has 
been called by the Rev. J. N. 
Hoare), that it was a w^ell 
recognised principle with the 
Greeks, that men ought to 
select their wives with a view 


to the health and vigour of 
their children. The Grecian 
poet, Theognis, who lived 550 
B.C., clearly saw how important 
selection, if carefully applied, 
would be for the improvement 
of mankind. He saw, likewise, 
that wealth often checks the 
proper action of sexual selection. 
He thus writes : 


“ With kine and horses, Kurnus ! we proceed 
By reasonable rules, and choose a breed 
For profit and increase, at any price ; 

Of a sound stock, without defect or vice. 

But, in the daily matches that we make. 

The price is everything : for money’s sake, 

Men marry : women are in marriage given 
The churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven, 
May match his ofispi ing with the proudest race : 
Thus everything is mix’d, noble and base 1 
If then in outward manner, form, and mind, 

You find us a degraded, motley kind, 

Wonder no more, my friend 1 the cause is plain. 
And to lament the consequence is vain.”

such full detail by Grodron and Quatrefages, that I 
need here only refer to their works.^^ Monstrosities, 
which graduate into slight variations, are likewise so 
similar in man and the lower animals, that the same 
classification and the same terms can be used for both, 
as has been shewn by Isidore Geoflfroy St. -Hilaire.^® 
In my work on the variation of domestic animals, I 
• have attempted to arrange in a rude fashion the laws 
of variation under the following heads: — The direct 
and definite action of changed conditions, as exhibited 
by all or nearly all the individuals of the same species, 
varying in the same manner under the same circum- 
stances. The efiects of the long- continued use or 
disuse of parts. The cohesion of homologous parts. 
The variability of multiple parts. Compensation of 
growth ; but of this law I have found no good instance 
in the case of man. The effects of the mechanical 
pressure of one part on another ; as of the pelvis on 
the cranium of the infant in the womb. Arrests of 
development, leading to the diminution or suppression 
of parts. The reappearance of long-lost characters 
through reversion. And lastly, correlated variation. 
All these so-called laws apply equally to man and the 
lower animals ; and most of them even to plants. It 
would be superfluous here to discuss all of them but

several are so important, that they must be treated 
at considerable length. 

The direct and definite action of changed conditions , — 
This is a most perplexing subject. It cannot be denied 
that changed conditions produce some, and occasionally 
a considerable effect, on organisms of all kinds ; and it 
seems at first probable that if sufficient time were 
allowed this would be the invariable result. But I 
have failed to obtain clear evidence in favour of this 
conclusion; and valid reasons may be urged on the 
other side, at least as far as the innumerable structures 
are concerned, which are adapted for special ends. There 
can, however, be no doubt that changed conditions 
induce an almost indefinite amount of fluctuating 
variability, by which the whole organisation is ren- 
dered in some degree plastic. 

In the United States, above 1,000,000 soldiers, who 
served in the late war, were measured, and the States 
in which they were born and reared were recorded.^’ 
From this astonishing number of observations it is 
proved that local influences of some kind act directly 
on stature ; and we further learn that “ the State 
“ where the physical growth has in great measure 
“ taken place, and the State of birth, which indicates 
“ the ancestry, seem to exert a marked influence on 

the stature.” For instance, it is established, “ that 

residence in the Western States, during the years of 
“ growth, tends to produce increase of stature.” On 
the other hand, it is certain that with sailors, their 
life delays growth, as shewn ‘‘ by the great difference 
“ between the statures of soldiers and sailors at the

** ages of seventeen and eighteen years.” Mr. B. A. 
Gould endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the 
influences which thus act on stature ; hut he arrived 
only at negative results, namely, that they did not 
relate to climate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor 
even in any controlling degree ” to the abundance or 
the need of the comforts of life. This latter conclusion 
is directly opposed to that arrived at by Yillerme, from 
the statistics of the height of the conscripts in different 
parts of France. When we compare the differences in 
stature between the Polynesian chiefs and the lower 
orders within the same islands, or between the in- 
habitants of the fertile volcanic and low barren coral 
islands of the same ocean,^® or again between the 
Fuegians on the eastern and western shores of their 
country, where the means of subsistence are very 
different, it is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion 
that better food and greater comfort do influence 
stature. But the preceding statements shew how 
difficult it is to arrive at, any precise result. Dr. 
Beddoe has lately proved that, with the inhabitants of 
Britain, residence in towns and certain occupations 
have a deteriorating influence on height ; and he infers 
that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is 
likewise the case in the United States. Dr. Beddoe 
further believes that wherever a “race attains its 
“ maximum of physical development, it rises highest in 
“ energy and moral vigour.”

Whether external conditions produce any other direct 
effect on man is not known. It might have been ex- 
pected that differences of climate would have had a 
marked influence, inasmuch as the lungs and kidneys 
ure brought into activity under a low temperature, 
xnd the liver and skin under a high one.^° It was 
formerly thought that the colour of the skin and the 
character of the hair were determined by light or 
heat ; and although it can hardly be denied that some 
effect is thus produced, almost all observers now agree 
that the effect has been very small, even after exposure 
during many ages. But this subject will be more 
properly discussed when we treat of the different races 
of mankind. With our domestic animals there are 
grounds for believing that cold and damp directly 
affect the growth of the hair ; but I have not met with 
any evidence oh this head in the case of man. 

Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts . — 
It is well known that use strengthens the muscles in 
the individual, and complete disuse, or the destruction 
of the proper nerve, weakens them. When the eye is 
destroyed, the optic nerve often becomes atrophied. 
When an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase 
not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength 
of their coats. When one kidney ceases to act from 
disease, the other increases in size, and does double 
work. Bones increase not only in thickness, but in 
length, from carrying a greater weight.^^ Different

occupations, habitually followed, lead to changed pro- 
portions in various parts of the body. Thus it was 
ascertained by the United States Commissions^ that 
the legs of the sailors employed in the late war were 
longer by 0*217 of an inch than those of the soldiers, 
though the sailors were on an average shorter men ; 
whilst their arms were shorter by 1*09 of an inch, and 
therefore, out of proportion, shorter in relation to their 
lesser height. This shortness of the arms is apparently 
due to their greater use, and is an unexpected result : 
but sailors chiefly use their arms in pulling, and not 
in supporting weights. With sailors, the girth of the 
neck and the depth of the instep are greater, whilst 
the circumference of the chest, waist, and hips is less, 
than in soldiers. 

Whether the several foregoing modifications would 
become hereditary, if the same habits of life were fol- 
lowed during many generations, is not known, but it is 
probable. Eengger^^ attributes the thin legs and thick 
arms of the Payaguas Indians to successive generations 
having passed nearly their whole lives in canoes, with 
their lower extremities motionless. Other writers have 
come to a similar conclusion in analogous cases. Ac- 
cording to Cranz,^^ who lived for a long time with the 
Esquimaux, ‘‘the natives believe that ingenuity and 
“ dexterity in seal- catching (their highest art and 
“ virtue) is hereditary ; there is really something in it, 
“ for the son of a celebrated seal-catcher will distinguish 
“ himself, though he lost his father in childhood.” But 
in this case it is mental aptitude, quite as much as

bodily structure, which appears to he inherited. It is 
asserted that the hands of English labourers are at 
birth larger than those of the gentry.^® From the 
correlation which exists, at least in some cases, 
between the development of the extremities and of 
the jaws, it is possible that in those classes which do 
not labour much with their hands and feet, the jaws 
would be reduced in size from this cause. That they 
are generally smaller in refined and civilised men than 
in hard-working men or savages, is certain. But with 
savages, as Mr. Herbert Spencer has remarked, the 
greater use of the jaws in chewing coarse, uncooked 
food, would act in a direct manner on the masticatory 
muscles, and on the bones to which they are attached. 
In infants, long before birth, the skin on the soles of 
the feet is thicker than on any other part of the 
body ; and it can hardly be doubted that this is due 
to the inherited effects of pressure during a long series 
of generations. 

It is familiar to every one that watchmakers and 
engravers are liable to be short-sighted, whilst men 
living much out of doors, and especially savages, are 
generally long-sighted.^® Short-sight and long-sight 
certainly tend to be inherited.^® The inferiority of

Europeans, in comparison with savages, in eyesight and 
in the other senses, is no doubt the accumulated and 
transmitted effect of lessened use during many genera- 
tions; for Eengger"*^ states that he has repeatedly oh< 
served Europeans, who had been brought up and spent 
their whole lives with the wild Indians, who nevertheless 
did not equal them in the sharpness of their senses. 
The same naturalist observes that the cavities in the 
skull for the reception of the several sense-organs are 
larger in the American aborigines than in Europeans ; 
and this probably indicates a corresponding difference 
in the dimensions of the organs themselves. Blumen- 
bach has also remarked on the large size of the nasal 
cavities in the skulls of the American aborigines, and 
connects this fact with their remarkably acute power 
of smell. The Mongolians of the plains of Northern 
Asia, according to Pallas, have wonderfully perfect 
senses ; and Prichard believes that the great breadth 
of their skulls across the zygomas follows from their 
highly-developed sense-organs.^^ 

The Quechua Indians inhabit the lofty plateaux of 
Peru; and Alcide d’Orbigny states that, from con- 
tinually breathing a highly rarefied atmosphere, they 
have acquired chests and lungs of extraordinary 
dimensions. The cells, also, of the lungs are larger

and more numerous than in Europeans. These ob- 
servations have been doubted; but Mr. D. Forbes 
carefully measured many Aymaras, an allied race, 
living at the height of between 10,000 and 15,000 
feet; and he informs me^^ that they differ con- 
spicuously from the men of all other races seen by 
him in the circumference and length of their bodies. 
In his table of measurements, the stature of each man 
is taken at 1000, and the other measurements are 
reduced to this standard. It is here seen that the 
extended arms of the Aymaras are shorter than those 
of Europeans, and much shorter than those of Negroes. 
The legs are likewise shorter ; and they present this re- 
markable peculiarity, that in every Aymara measured, 
the femur is actually shorter than the tibia. On an 
average, the length of the femur to that of the tibia 
is as 211 to 252 ; whilst in two Europeans, measured 
at the same time, the femora to the tibiae were as 244 
to 230 ; and in three Negroes as 258 to 241. The 
humerus is likewise shorter relatively to the forearm. 
This shortening of that part of the limb which is 
nearest to the body, appears to be, as suggested to me 
by Mr. Forbes, a case of compensation in relation with 
the greatly increased length of the trunk. The 
Aymaras present some other singular points of structure, 
for instance, the very small projection of the heel. 

These men are so thoroughly acclimatised to their 
cold and lofty abode, that when formerly carried down 
by the Spaniards to the low eastern plains, and when 
now tempted down by high wages to the gold- washings,

they suffer a frightful rate of mortality. Nevertheless 
Mr. Forbes found a few pure families which had sur- 
vived during two generations : and he observed that 
they still inherited their characteristic peculiarities. 
But it was manifest, even without measurement, that 
these peculiarities had all decreased ; and on measure- 
ment, their bodies were found not to be so much 
elongated as those of the men on the high plateau ; 
whilst their femora had become somewhat lengthened, 
as had their tibiae, although in a less degree. The 
actual measurements may be seen by consulting Mr. 
Forbes’s memoir. From these observations, there can, 
I think, be no doubt that residence during many 
generations at a great elevation tends, both directly 
and indirectly, to induce inherited modifications in the 
proportions of the body.^® 

Although man may not have been much modified 
during the latter stages of his existence through the 
increased or decreased use of parts, the facts now given 
shew that his liability in this respect has not been 
lost ; and we positively know that the same law holds 
good with the lower animals. Consequently we may 
infer that when at a remote epoch the progenitors of 
man were in a transitional state, and were changing 
from quadrupeds into bipeds, natural selection would 
probably have been greatly aided by the inherited effects 
of the increased or diminished use of the different parts 
of the body.

arrested development and arrested growth, for parts in 
the former state continue to grow whilst still retaining 
their early condition. Various monstrosities come under 
this head ; and some, as a cleft-palate, are known 
to be occasionally inherited. It will suffice for our 
purpose to refer to the arrested brain-development of 
microcephalous idiots, as described in Vogt’s memoir.®® 
Their skulls are smaller, and the convolutions of the 
brain are less complex than in normal men. The 
frontal sinus, or the projection over the eye-brows, is 
largely developed, and the jaws are prognathous to an 
‘‘ effrayant ” degree ; so that these idiots somewhat 
resemble the lower types of mankind. Their in- 
telligence, and most of their mental faculties, are 
extremely feeble. They cannot acquire the power of 
speech, and are wholly incapable of prolonged atten- 
tion, but are much given to imitation. They are 
strong and remarkably active, continually gambolling 
and jumping about, and making grimaces. They often 
ascend stairs on all-fours; and are curiously fond of 
climbing up furniture or trees. We are thus reminded 
of the delight shewn by almost all boys in climbing 
trees ; and this again reminds us how lambs and kids, 
originally alpine animals, delight to frisk on any 
hillock, however small. Idiots also resemble the 
lower animals in some other respects ; thus several 
cases are recorded of their carefully smelling every 
mouthful of food before eating it. One idiot is de- 
scribed as often using his mouth in aid of his hands, 
whilst hunting for lice. They are often filthy in their 
habits, and have no sense of decency ; and several cases

Reversion , — Many of the cases to be here given, 
might have been introduced under the last heading. 
When a structure is arrested in its development, but 
still continues growing, until it closely resembles a 
corresponding structure in some lower and adult 
member of the same group, it may in one sense be 
considered as a case of reversion. The lower members 
in a group give us some idea how the common pro- 
genitor was probably constructed ; and it is hardly 
credible that a complex part, arrested at an early 
phase of embryonic development, should go on growing 
so as ultimately to perform its proper function, unless 
it had acquired such power during some earlier state 
of existence, when the present exceptional or arrested 
structure was normal. The simple brain of a micro- 
cephalous idiot, in as far as it resembles that of an 
ape, may in this sense be said to offer a case of 
reversion."® There are other cases which come more 


^ Prof. Laycock sums up the 
character of brute-like idiots by 
calling them theroid ; ‘Journal 
of Mental Science,’ July, 1863. 
Dr. Scott (‘ The Deaf and Dumb,’ 
2nd edit., 1870, p. 10) has often 
observed the imbecile smelling 
their food. See, on this same 
subject, and on the hairiness of 
idiots. Dr. Maudsley, ‘ Body and 
Mind,’ 1870, pp. 46-51. Pinel 
has also given a striking case of 
hairiness in an idiot. 

In my ‘Variation of Ani- 
mals under Domestication ’ (vol. 
ii. p. 67), I attributed the not 
very rare cases of supernumerary 


mammae in Women to reversion. 
I was led to this as a probable 
conclusion, by the additional 
mammae being generally placed 
symmetrically on the breast; and 
more especially from one case, in 
which a single efficient mamma 
occurred in the inguinal region 
of a woman, the daughter of 
another woman with supernu- 
merary mammae. But I now 
find (see, for instance. Prof. 
Preyer, ‘ Der Kampf um das 
Dasein,’ 1869, s. 45) that mam- 
mce erraticcB occur in other 
situations, as on the back, in 
the armpit, and on the thigh;

strictly under our present head of reversion. Certain 
structures, regularly occurring in the lower members 


the mammaB in this latter in- 
stance having given so much 
milk that the child was thus 
nourished. The probability that 
the additional mammae are due 
to reversion is thus much weak- 
ened ; nevertheless, it still seems 
to me probable, because two pairs 
are often found symmetrically on 
the breast ; and of this I myself 
have received information in 
several cases. It is well known 
that some Lemurs normally have 
two pairs of mammse on the 
breast. Five cases have been 
recorded of the presence of more 
than a pair of mammae (of course 
rudimentary) in the male sex of 
mankind ; see ‘ Journal of Anat. 
and Physiology,’ 1872, p. 56, for 
a case given by Dr. Handyside, 
in which two brothers exhibited 
this peculiarity ; see also a paper 
by Dr. Bartels, in ‘Reichert’s 
and du Bois-Reymond’s Archiv.,’ 
1872, p. 304. In one of the cases 
alluded to by Dr. Bartels, a man 
bore five mammae, one being 
medial and placed above the 
navel; Meckel von Hemsbach 
thinks that this latter case is 
illustrated by a medial mamma 
occurring in certain Cheiroptera. 
On the whole, we may well doubt 
if additional mammse would ever 
have been developed in both sexes 
of mankind, had not his early 
progenitors been provided with 
more than a single pair. 

In the above work (voL ii. p. 
12), I also attributed, though 
with much hesitation, the fre- 
quent cases of polydactylism in 
men and various animals to re- 


version. I was partly led to 
this through Prof. Owen’s state- 
ment, that some of the Ichthy- 
opterygia possess more than five 
digits, and therefore, as I sup- 
posed, had retained a primordial 
condition ; but Prof. Gegenbaur 
(‘ Jenaischen Zeitschrift,’ B. v. 
Heft 3, s. 341), disputes Owen’s 
conclusion. On the other hand, 
according to the opinion lately 
advanced by Dr. Gunther, on 
the paddle of Ceratodus, which 
is provided with articulated bony 
rays on both sides of a central 
chain of bones, there seems no 
great difiBculty in admitting that 
six or more digits on one side, 
or on both sides, might reappear 
through reversion. I am in- 
formed by Dr. Zouteveen that 
there is a case on record of a 
man having twenty-four fingers 
and twenty-four toes! I was 
chiefly led to the conclusion that 
the presence of supernumerary 
digits might be due to reversion 
from the fact that such digits, 
not only are strongly inherited, 
but, as I then believed, had the 
power of regrowth after ampu- 
tation, like the normal digits of 
the lower vertebrata. But I 
have explained in the Second 
Edition of my Variation under 
Domestication why I now place 
little reliance on the recorded 
cases of such regrowth. Never- 
theless it deserves notice, inas- 
much as arrested development 
and reversion are intimately re- 
lated processes ; that various 
structures in an embryonic or 
arrested condition, such as a

of the group to which man belongs, occasionally make 
their appearance in him, though not found in the 
normal human embryo; or, if normally present in 
the human embryo, they become abnormally developed, 
although in a manner which is normal in the lower 
members of the group. These remarks will be rendered 
clearer by the following illustrations. 

In various mammals the uterus graduates from a 
double organ with two distinct orifices and two 
passages, as in the marsupials, into a single organ, 
which is in no way double except from having a slight 
internal fold, as in the higher apes and man. The 
rodents exhibit a perfect series of gradations between 
these two extreme states. In all mammals the uterus 
is developed from two simple primitive tubes, the 
inferior portions of which form the cornua ; and it is 
in the words of Dr. Farre, “ by the coalescence of the 
“ two cornua at their lower extremities that the body 
‘‘ of the uterus is formed in man ; w^hile in those 
“ animals in which no middle portion or body exists, 
“ the cornua remain ununited. As the development of 
“ the uterus proceeds, the two cornua become gradually 
‘‘ shorter, until at length they are lost, or, as it were, 
“ absorbed into the body of the uterus.” The angles 
of the uterus are still produced into cornua, even in 
animals as high up in the scale as the lower apes and 
lemurs. 

Now in women, anomalous cases are not very infre- 

cleft palate, bifid uterus, &c., course to give up altogether the 
are frequently accompanied by idea that there is any relation 
polydactylism. This has been between the development of su- 
strongly insisted on by Meckel pernumerary digits and reversion 
and Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire. to some lowly organised pro-

qnent, in which the mature uterus is furnished with 
cornua, or is partially divided into two organs ; and 
such cases, according to Owen, repeat the grade 
‘‘of concentrative development,” attained by certain 
rodents. Here perhaps we have an instance of a simple 
arrest of embryonic development, with subsequent 
growth and perfect functional development ; for either 
side of the partially double uterus is capable of per- 
forming the proper office of gestation. In other and 
rarer cases, two distinct uterine cavities are formed, 
each having its proper orifice and passage.®* No such 
stage is passed through during the ordinary develop- 
ment of the embryo ; and it is difficult to believe, 
though perhaps not impossible, that the two simple, 
minute, primitive tubes should know how (if such an 
expression may be used) to grow into two distinct 
uteri, each with a well-constructed orifice and passage, 
and each furnished with numerous muscles, nerves, 
glands and vessels, if they had not formerly passed 
through a similar course of development, as in the case 
of existing marsupials. No one will pretend that so 
perfect a structure as the abnormal double uterus in 
woman could be the result of mere chance. But the 
principle of reversion, by which a long-lost structure is 
called back into existence, might serve as the guide for 
its full development, even after the lapse of an enor- 
mous interval of time. 

Professor Canestrini, after discussing the foregoing 
and various analogous cases, arrives at the same con- 
clusion as that just given. He adduces another

instance, in the case of the malar hone,*° which, in 
some of the Quadrumana and other mammals, normally 
consists of two portions. This is its condition in the 
human foetus when two months old ; and through 
arrested development, it sometimes remains thus in 
man when adult, more especially in the lower progna- 
thous races. Hence Canestrini concludes that some 
ancient progenitor of man must have had this hone 
normally divided into two portions, which afterwards 
became fused together. In man the frontal hone 
consists of a single piece, hut in the embryo, and in 
children, and in almost all the lower mammals, it con- 
sists of two pieces separated by a distinct suture. This 
suture occasionally persists more or less distinctly in 
man after maturity ; and more frequently in ancient 
than in recent crania, especially, as Canestrini has 
observed, in those exhumed from the Drift, and belong- 
ing to the brachycephalic type. Here again he comes 
to the same conclusion as in the analogous case of the 
malar bones. In this, and other instances presently to 


‘ Annuario della Soc. del 
Naturalisti in Modena,’ 1867, 
p. 83. Prof. Canestrini gives 
extracts on this subject from 
various authorities. Laurillard 
remarks, that as he has found a 
complete similarity in the form, 
proportions, and connection of 
the two malar hones in several 
human subjects and in certain 
apes, he cannot consider this 
disposition of the parts as simply 
accidental. Another paper on 
this same anomaly has been 
published by Dr. Saviotti in the 
‘ Gazzetta delle Cliniche,’ Turin, 
1871, where he says that traces 
of the division may be detected 


in about two per cent, of adult 
skulls ; he also remarks that it 
more frequently occurs in prog- 
nathous skulls, not of the Aryan 
race, than in others. See also 
G. Delorenzi on the same sub- 
ject ; ‘ Tre nuovi casi d’ anomalia 
deir osso malare,’ Torino, 1872. 
Also, E. Morselli, ‘Sopra una 
rara anomalia dell’ osso malare,’ 
Modena, 1872. Still more re- 
cently Gruber has written a 
pamphlet on the division of this 
bone. I give these references 
because a reviewer, without any 
grounds or scruples, has thrown 
doubts on my statements.

be given, the canse of ancient races approaching the 
lower animals in certain characters more frequently 
than do the modern races, appears to be, that the 
latter stand at a somewhat greater distance in the long 
line of descent from their early semi-human pro- 
genitors. 

Various other anomalies in man, more or less ana- 
logous to the foregoing, have been advanced by dif- 
ferent authors, as cases of reversion ; but these seem 
not a little doubtful, for we have to descend extremely 
low in the mammalian series, before we find such 
structures normally present.^^ 

In man, the canine teeth are perfectly efficient 
instruments for mastication. But their true canine 
character, as Owen^^ remarks, “ is indicated by the 
“ conical form of the crown, which terminates in an 
“ obtuse point, is convex outward and flat or sub-con- 
cave within, at the base of which surface there is a 
feeble prominence. The conical form is best expressed 
in the Melanian races, especially the Australian. 


A whole series of cases is 
given by Isid. Geoff roy St.- 
Hilaire, ‘ Hist, des Anomalies,’ 
tom. iii. p. 437. A reviewer 
(‘ Journal of Anat. and Physio- 
logy,’ 1871, p. 366) blames me 
much for not having discussed 
the numerous cases, which have 
been recorded, of various parts 
arrested in their development. 
He says that, according to my 
theory, “ every transient con- 
“ dition of an organ, during its 
“development, is not only a 
“ means to an end, but once was 
“an end in itself.” This does 
not seem to me necessarily to 
hold good. Why should not 


variations occur during an early 
period of development, having 
no relation to reversion ; yet 
such variations might be pre- 
served and accumulated, if in 
any way serviceable, for instance, 
in shortening and simplifying 
the course of development ? And 
again, why should not injurious 
abnormalities, such as atrophied 
or hypertrophied parts, which 
have no relation to a former 
state of existence, occur at an 
early period, as well as during 
maturity ?

“The canine is more deeply implanted, and by a 
“ stronger fang than the incisors.” Nevertheless, this 
tooth no longer serves man as a special weapon for 
tearing his enemies or prey ; it may, therefore, as far 
as its proper function is concerned, be considered as 
rudimentary. In every large collection of human 
skulls some may be found, as Hackel observes, with 
the canine teeth projecting considerably beyond the 
others in the same manner as in the anthropomorphous 
apes, but in a less degree. In these cases, open spaces 
between the teeth in the one jaw are left for the 
reception of the canines of the opposite jaw. An inter- 
space of this kind in a Kaffir skull, figured by Wagner, 
is surprisingly wide.*^ Considering how few are the 
ancient skulls which have been examined, compared to 
recent skulls, it is an interesting fact that in at least 
three cases the canines project largely; and in the 
Naulette jaw they are spoken of as enormous.*® 

Of the anthropomorphous apes the males alone have 
their canines fully developed ; but in the female 
gorilla, and in a less degree in the female orang, these 
teeth project considerably beyond the others; therefore 
the fact, of which I have been assured, that women 
sometimes have considerably projecting canines, is no 
serious objection to the belief that their occasional 
great development in man is a case of reversion to an 
ape-like progenitor. He who rejects with scorn the 
belief that the shape of his own canines, and their 
occasional great development in other men, are due to

onr early forefathers having been provided with these 
formidable weapons, will probably reveal, by sneering, 
the line of his descent. For though he no longer 
intends, nor has the power, to use these teeth as wea- 
pons, he will unconsciously retract his “ snarling 
muscles ” (thus named by Sir C. Bell),^® so as to expose 
them ready for action, like a dog prepared to fight. 

Many muscles are occasionally developed in man, 
which are proper to the Quadrumana or other mammals. 
Professor Ylacovich examined forty male subjects, 
and found a muscle, called by him the ischio-pubic, in 
nineteen of them ; in three others there was a liga- 
ment which represented this muscle ; and in the 
remaining eighteen no tr^ce of it. In only two out of 
thirty female subjects was this muscle developed on 
both sides, but in three others the rudimentary liga- 
ment was present. This muscle, therefore, appears to 
be much more common in the male than in the female 
sex ; and on the belief in the descent of man from some 
lower form, the fact is intelligible ; for it has been 
detected in several of the lower animals, and in all of 
these it serves exclusively to aid the male in the act of 
reproduction.

** These papers deserve care- 
ful study by any one who 
desires to learn how frequently 
our muscles vary, and in varying 
come to resemble those of the 
Quadrumana. The following

vol. xvi. 1868, p. 524. I may 
here add that Dr. Murie and 
Mr. St. George Mivart have 
shewn in their Memoir on the 
Lemuroidea (‘ Transact. Zoolog. 
Soc.’ vol. vii. 1869, p. 96), how 
extraordinarily variable some of 
the muscles are in these animals, 


62 THE DESCENT OF MAN. Part I. 

minutely described a vast number of muscular variations 
in man, which resemble normal structures in the lower 
animals. The muscles which closely resemble those 
regularly present in our nearest allies, the Quad- 
rumana, are too numerous to be here even specified. 
In a single male subject, having a strong bodily frame, 
and well-formed skull, no less than seven muscular 
variations were observed, all of which plainly repre- 
sented muscles proper to various kinds of apes. 
This man, for instance, had on both sides of his neck a 
true and powerful “ levator daviculse^^ such as is found 
in all kinds of apes, and which is said to occur in about 
one out of sixty human subjects.'*^ Again, this man 
had “ a special abductor of the metatarsal bone of the 
“ fifth digit, such as Professor Huxley and Mr. Flower 
“ have shewn to exist uniformly in the higher and 
“ lower apes.” I will give only two additional cases ; 
the acromio-hasilar muscle is found in all mammals 
below man, and seems to be correlated with a quadru- 
pedal gait,^® and it occurs in about one out of sixty 
human subjects. In the lower extremities Mr. 
Bradley found an abductor osds metatarsi quinti in 
both feet of man ; this muscle had not up to that time 
been recorded in mankind, but is always present in the 
anthropomorphous apes. The muscles of the hands 
and arms — parts which are so eminently characteristic 
of man — are extremely liable to vary, so as to resemble 


the lowest members of the ‘Proc. E. Irish Academy,’ vol. 
Primates. Gradations, also, in x. 1868, p. 124.

the corresponding muscles in the lower animals.^^ 
Such resemblances are either perfect or imperfect ; yet 
in the latter case they are manifestly of a transitional 
nature. Certain variations are more common in man, 
and others in woman, without our being able to assign 
any reason. Mr. Wood, after describing numerous 
variations, makes the following pregnant remark: 
“Notable departures from the ordinary type of the 
“muscular structures run in grooves or directions, 
“ which must be taken to indicate some unknown 


“ factor, of much importance to a comprehensive know- 
“ ledge of general and scientific anatomy.” 

That this unknown factor is reversion to a former 
state of existence may be admitted as in the highest 
degree probable.®^ It is quite incredible that a man 


Prof. Macalister (ibid. p. 
121) has tabulated his obser- 
vations, and finds that muscular 
abnormalities are most frequent 
in the fore-arms, secondly, in 
the face, thirdly, in the foot, &c. 

“ The Kev. Dr. Haughton, 
after giving (‘ Proc. K. Irish 
Academy,’ June 27, 1864, p. 
715) a remarkable case of varia- 
tion in the human flexor poUicis 
longus, adds, “ This remarkable 
“ example shows that man may 
“ sometimes possess the arrange- 
“ ment of tendons of thumb and 
“ fingers characteristic of the 
“ macaque ; but whether such a 
“ case should be regarded as a 
“ macaque passing upwards into 
“ a man, or a man passing 
“ downwards into a macaque, or 
“ as a congenital freak of nature, 
“I cannot undertake to say.” 
It is satisfactory to hear so 
capable an anatomist, and so 
embittered an opponent of 


evolutionism, admitting even the 
possibility of either of his first 
propositions. Prof. Macalister 
has also described (‘ Proc. K. 
Irish Acad.’ vol. x. 1864, p. 138) 
variations in the flexor pollicis 
Icyagusy remarkable from their 
relations to the same muscle in 
the Quadrumana. 

Since the first edition of 
this book appeared, Mr. Wood 
has published another memoir in 
the ‘ Phil. Transactions,’ 1870, 
p. 83, on the varieties of the 
muscles of the human neck, 
shoulder, and chest. He here 
shows how extremely variable 
these muscles are, and how often 
and how closely the variations 
resemble the normal muscles of 
the lower animals. He sums up 
by remarking, “ It will be 
“ enough for my purpose if I 
“ have succeeded in shewing the 
“ more im^iortant forms which, 
“ when occurring as varieties in 


64 THE DESCENT OF MAN. Part I. 

should through mere accident abnormally resemble 
certain apes in no less than seven of his muscles, if 
there had been no genetic connection between them. 
On the other hand, if man is descended from some ape- 
like creature, no valid reason can be assigned why 
certain muscles should not suddenly reappear after an 
interval of many thousand generations, in the same 
manner as with horses, asses, and mules, dark-coloured 
stripes suddenly reappear on the legs, and shoulders, 
after an interval of hundreds, or more probably of 
thousands of generations. 

These various cases of reversion are so closely 
related to those of rudimentary organs given in the 
first chapter, that many of them might have been 
indifferently introduced either there or here. Thus a 
human uterus furnished with cornua may be said to 
represent, in a rudimentary condition, the same organ 
in its normal state in certain mammals. Some parts 
which are rudimentary in man, as the os coccyx in 
both sexes, and the mammae in the male sex, are always 
present ; whilst others, such as the supracondyloid 
foramen, only occasionally appear, and therefore might 
have been introduced under the head of reversion. 
These several reversionary structures, as well as the 
strictly rudimentary ones, reveal the descent of man 
from some lower form in an unmistakable manner. 

Correlated Variation . — In man, as in the lower 
animals, many structures are so intimately related. 


“ the human subject, tend to “ Darwinian principle of rever- 
“ exhibit in a sufficiently marked “sion, or law of inheritance, in

that when one part varies so does another, without our 
being able, in most cases, to assign any reason. We 
cannot say whether the one part governs the other, or 
whether both are governed by some earlier developed 
part. Various monstrosities, as I. Geoffrey repeatedly 
insists, are thus intimately connected. Homologous 
structures are particularly liable to change together, 
as we see on the opposite sides of the body, and in 
the upper and lower extremities. Meckel long ago 
remarked, that when the muscles of the arm depart 
from their proper type, they almost always imitate 
those of the leg ; and so, conversely, with the muscles 
of the legs. The organs of sight and hearing, the teeth 
and hair, the colour of the skin and of the hair, colour 
and constitution, are more or less correlated.®® Pro- 
fessor Schaaffhausen first drew attention to the relation 
apparently existing between a muscular frame and the 
strongly-pronounced supra-orbital ridges, which are so 
characteristic of the lower races of man. 

Besides the variations which can be grouped with 
more or less probability under the foregoing heads, 
there is a large class of variations which may be 
provisionally called spontaneous, for to our ignorance 
they appear to arise without any exciting cause. It 
can, however, be shewn that such variations, whether 
consisting of slight individual differences, or of 
strongly-marked and abrupt deviations of structure, 
depend much more on the constitution of the organism 
than on the nature of the conditions to which it has 
been subjected.®®

and, according to a calculation, by Euler, this might 
occur in a little over twelve years.®^ At the former 
rate, the present population of the United States 
(thirty millions), would in 657 years cover the whole 
terraqueous globe so thickly, that four men would have 
to stand on each square yard of surface. The primary 
or fundamental check to the continued increase of man 
is the difiiculty of gaining subsistence, and of living in 
comfort. We may infer that this is the case from 
what we see, for instance, in the United States, where 
subsistence is easy, and there is plenty of room. If 
such means were suddenly doubled in Great Britain, 
our number would be quickly doubled. With civilised 
nations this primary check acts chiefly by restraining 
marriages. The greater death-rate of infants in the 
poorest classes is also very important ; as well as the 
greater mortality, from various diseases, of the inhabi- 
tants of crowded and miserable houses, at all ages. 
The effects of severe epidemics and wars are soon 
counterbalanced, and more than counterbalanced, in 
nations placed under favourable conditions. Emigra- 
tion also comes in aid as a temporary check, but, with 
the extremely poor classes, not to any great extent. 

There is reason to suspect, as Malthus has remarked, 
that the reproductive power is actually less in barbar- 
ous, than in civilised races. We know nothing

positively on this head, for with savages no census has 
been taken ; but from the concurrent testimony of 
missionaries, and of others who have long resided with 
such people, it appears that their families are usually 
small, and large ones rare. This may he partly 
accounted for, as it is believed, by the women suckling 
their infants during a long time ; hut it is highly 
probable that savages, who often suffer much hardship, 
and who do not obtain so much nutritious food as 
civilised men, would he actually less prolific. . I have 
shewn in a former work,®® that all our domesticated 
quadrupeds and birds, and all our cultivated plants, 
are more fertile than the corresponding species in a 
state of nature. It is no valid objection to this con- 
clusion that animals suddenly supplied with an excess 
of food, or when grown very fat ; and that most plants 
on sudden removal from very poor to very rich soil, are 
rendered more or less sterile. We might, therefore, 
expect that civilised men, who in one sense are highly 
domesticated, would be more prolific than wild men. 
It is also probable that the increased fertility of 
civilised nations would become, as with our domestic 
animals, an inherited character : it is at least known 
that with mankind a tendency to produce twins runs 
in families.®® 

Notwithstanding that savages appear to be less 
prolific than civilised people, they would no doubt 
rapidly increase if their numbers were not by some 
means rigidly kept down. The Santali, or hill-tribes 
of India, have recently afforded a good illustration of

this fact ; for, as shewn by Mr. Hunter,®® they have 
increased at an extraordinary rate since vaccination 
has been introduced, other pestilences mitigated, and 
war sternly repressed. This increase, however, would 
not have been possible had not these rude people spread 
into the adjoining districts, and worked for hire. 
Savages almost always marry ; yet there is some 
prudential restraint, for they do not commonly marry 
at the earliest possible age. The young men are often 
required, to shew that they can support a wife ; and 
they generally have first to earn the price with which 
to purchase her from her parents. With savages the 
difficulty of obtaining subsistence occasionally limits 
their number in a much more direct manner than with 
civilised people, for all tribes periodically suffer from 
severe famines. At such times savages are forced to 
devour much bad food, and their health can hardly fail 
to be injured. Many accounts have been published of 
their protruding stomachs and emaciated limbs after 
and during famines. They are then, also, compelled 
to wander much, and, as I was assured in Australia, 
their infants perish in large numbers. As famines are 
periodical, depending chiefiy on extreme seasons, all 
tribes must fiuctuate in number. They cannot steadily 
and regularly increase, as there is no artificial increase 
in the supply of food. Savages, when hard pressed, 
encroach on each other’s territories, and war is the 
result ; but they are indeed almost always at war with 
their neighbours. They are liable to many accidents 
on land and water in their search for food ; and in 
some countries they suffer much from the larger beasts

of prey. Even in India, districts have been depopu- 
lated by the ravages of tigers. 

Mai thus has discussed these several checks, but he 
does not lay stress enough on what is probably the 
most important of all, namely infanticide, especially of 
female infants, and the h^abit of procuring abortion. 
These practices now prevail in many quarters of the 
world; and infanticide seems formerly to have pre- 
vailed, as Mr. McLennan has shewn, on a still more 
extensive scale. These practices appear to have 
originated in savages recognising the difficulty, or 
rather the impossibility of supporting all the infants 
that are born. Licentiousness may also be added to 
the foregoing checks; but this does not follow from 
failing means of subsistence ; though there is reason 
to believe that in some cases (as in Japan) it has been 
intentionally encouraged as a means of keeping down 
the population. 

If we look back to an extremely remote epoch, before 
man had arrived at the dignity of manhood, he would 
have been guided more by instinct and less by reason 
than are the lowest savages at the present time. Our 
early semi-human progenitors would not have practised 
infanticide or polyandry : for the instincts of the lower 
animals are never so perverted as to lead them re-

gularly to destroy their own offspring, or to be quite 
devoid of jealousy. There would have been no pru- 
dential restraint from marriage, and the sexes would 
have freely united at an early age. Hence the pro- 
genitors of man would have tended to increase rapidly ; 
but checks of some kind, either periodical or constant, 
must have kept down their numbers, even more severely 
than with existing savages. What the precise nature 
of these checks were, we cannot say, any more than 
with most other animals. We know that horses 3,nd 
cattle, which are not extremely prolific animals, when 
first turned loose in South America, increased at an 
enormous rate. The elephant, the slowest breeder of 
all known animals, would in a few thousand years stock 
the whole world. The increase of every species of 
monkey must be checked by some means ; but not, as 
Brehm remarks, by the attacks of beasts of prey. No 
one will assume that the actual power of reproduction 
in the wild horses and cattle of America, was at first in 
any sensible degree increased ; or that, as each district 
became fully stocked, this same power was diminished. 
No doubt in this case, and in all others, many checks 
concur, and different checks under different circum- 
stances ; periodical dearths, depending on unfavourable 
seasons, being probably the most important of all. So 
it will have been with the early progenitors of man.

induced, either directly or indirectly, by the same 
general causes, and obey the same general laws, as with 
the lower animals. Man has spread widely over the 
face of the earth, and must have been exposed, during 
his incessant migrations,®^ to the most diversified 
conditions. The inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, the 
Cape of Good Hope, and Tasmania in the one hemi- 
sphere, and of the Arctic regions in the other, must 
have passed through many climates, and changed their 
habits many times, before they reached their present 
homes.®^ The early progenitors of man must also have 
tended, like all other animals, to have increased beyond 
their means of subsistence ; they must, therefore, 
occasionally have been exposed to a struggle for exis- 
tence, and consequently to the rigid law of natural 
selection. Eeneficial variations of all kinds will thus, 
either occasionally or habitually, have been preserved 
and injurious ones eliminated. I do not refer to 
strongly-marked deviations of structure, which occur 
only at long intervals of time, but to mere individual 
differences. We know, for instance, that the muscles 
of our hands and feet, which determine our powers of 
movement, are liable, like those of the lower animals,®® 
to incessant variability. If then the progenitors of 
man inhabiting any district, especially one undergoing 
some change in its conditions, were divided into two

equal bodies, the one half which included all the 
individuals best adapted by their powers of movement 
for gaining subsistence, or for defending themselves, 
would on an average survive in greater numbers, and 
procreate more offspring than the other and less well 
endowed half. 

Man in the rudest state in which he now exists is 
the most dominant animal that has ever appeared on 
this earth. He has spread more widely than any other 
highly organised form : and all others have yielded 
before him. He manifestly owes this immense 
superiority to his intellectual faculties, to his social 
habits, which lead him to aid and defend his fellows, 
and to his corporeal structure. The supreme impor- 
tance of these characters has been proved by the final 
Arbitrament of the battle for life. Through his powers 
of intellect, articulate language has been evolved ; and 
on this his wonderful advancement has mainly depended. 
As Mr. Chauncey Wright remarks “a psychological 
‘ analysis of the faculty of language shews, that even 
“ the smallest proficiency in it might require more 
“ brain power than the greatest proficiency in any 
“ other direction.” He has invented and is able to use 
various weapons, tools, traps, &c., with which he defends 
himself, kills or catches prey, and otherwise obtains 
food. He has made rafts or canoes for fishing or 
crossing over to neighbouring fertile islands. He has 
discovered the art of making fire, by which hard and 
stringy roots can be rendered digestible, and poisonous 
roots or herbs innocuous. This discovery of fire, 
probably the greatest ever made by man,, excepting

language, dates from before the dawn of history. 
These several inventions, by which man in the rudest 
state has become so pre-eminent, are the direct results 
of the development of his powers of observation, 
memory, curiosity, imagination, and reason. I cannot, 
therefore, understand how it is that Mr. Wallace 
maintains, that “ natural selection could only have 
“ endowed the savage with a brain a little superior to 
“ that of an ape.” 

Although the intellectual powers and social habits of 
man are of paramount importance to him, we must not 
underrate the importance of his bodily structure, to 
which subject the remainder of this chapter will be 
devoted ; the development of the intellectual and social 
or moral faculties being discussed in a later chapter. 

Even to hammer with precision is no easy matter, as

Wallace’s ‘ Contributions to the

referred to in this work are re-

Man,’ has been ably criticised 
by Prof. Claparede, one of the 
most distiDguished zoologists in 
Europe, in an article published 
in the ‘ Bibliotheque Univer-

most just remark by Sir J.

muscles of the hand, arm, and shoulder, and, further, a 
fine sense of touch. In throwing a stone or spear, and 
in many other actions, a man must stand firmly on his 
feet ; and this again demands the perfect co-adaptation 
of numerous muscles. To chip a flint into the rudest 
tool, or to form a barbed spear or hook from a bone, 
demands the use of a perfect hand ; for, as a most 
capable judge, Mr. Schoolcraft,®® remarks, the shaping 
fragments of stone into knives, lances, or arrow-heads, 
shews “ extraordinary ability and long practice.” This 
is to a great extent proved by the fact that primeval 
men practised a division of labour ; each man did not 
manufacture his own flint tools or rude pottery, but 
certain individuals appear to have devoted themselves 
to such work, no doubt receiving in exchange the 
produce of the chase. Archaeologists are convinced 
that an enormous interval of time elapsed before our 
ancestors thought of grinding chipped flints into 
smooth tools. One can hardly doubt, that a man-like 
animal who possessed a hand and arm sufficiently 
perfect to throw a stone with precision, or to form a 
flint into a rude tool, could, with sufficient practice, as 
far as mechanical skill alone is concerned, make almost 
anything which a civilised man can make. The 
structure of the hand in this respect may be compared 
with that of the vocal organs, which in the apes are used 
for uttering various signal- cries, or, as in one genus, 
musical cadences ; but in man the closely similar vocal 
organs have become adapted through the inherited 
effects of use for the utterance of articulate language.

Turning now to the nearest allies of men, and 
therefore to the best representatives of our early 
progenitors, we find that the hands of the Quadrunjana 
are constructed on the same general pattern as our 
own, but are far less perfectly adapted for diversified 
uses. Their hands do not serve for locomotion so well 
as the feet of a dog ; as may be seen in such monkeys 
as the chimpanzee and orang, which walk on the outer 
margins of the palms, or on the knuckles.®® Their 
hands, however, are admirably adapted for climbing 
trees. Monkeys seize thin branches or ropes, with the 
thumb on one side and the fingers and palm on the 
other, in the same manner as we do. They can thus 
also lift rather large objects, such as the neck of a 
bottle, to their mouths. Baboons turn over stones, 
and scratch up roots with their hands. They seize 
nuts, insects, or other small objects with the thumb in 
opposition to the fingers, and no doubt they thus 
extract eggs and the young from the nests of birds. 
American monkeys beat the wild oranges on the 
branches until the rind is cracked, and then tear it off 
with the fingers of the two hands. In a wild state they 
break open hard fruits with stones. Other monkeys 
open mussel-shells with the two thumbs. With their 
fingers they pull out thorns and burs, and hunt for 
each other’s parasites. They roll down stones, or 
throw them at their enemies : nevertheless, thev are 
clumsy in these various actions, and, as I have myself 
seen, are quite unable to throw a stone with precision. 

It seems to me far from true that because “ objects 
“ are grasped clumsily ” by monkeys, a much less 
“ specialised organ of prehension ” would have served

them’® equally well with their present hands. On the 
contrary, I see no reason to doubt that more perfectly 
constructed hands would have been an advantage to 
them, provided that they were not thus rendered less 
fitted for climbing trees. We may suspect that a 
hand as perfect as that of man would have been dis- 
advantageous for climbing ; for the most arboreal 
monkeys in the world, namely, Ateles in America, 
Colobus in Africa, and Hylobates in Asia, are either 
thumbless, or their toes partially cohere, so that their 
limbs are converted into mere grasping hooks.” 

As soon as some ancient member in the great series 
of the Primates came to be less arboreal, owing to a 
change in its manner of procuring subsistence, or to 
some change in the surrounding conditions, its habitual 
manner of progression would have been modified : and 
thus it would have been rendered more strictly quad- 
rupedal or bipedal. Baboons frequent hilly and rocky 
districts, and only from necessity climb high trees ; 
and they have acquired almost the gait of a dog. Man 
alone has become a biped ; and we can, I think, partly 
see how he has come to assume his erect attitude, 
which forms one of his most conspicuous characters. 
Man could not have attained his present dominant 
position in the world without the use of his hands.

which are so admirably adapted to act in obedience to 
his will. Sir C. BelP® insists that “ the hand supplies 
“ all instruments, and by its correspondence with the 
“ intellect gives him universal dominion.” But the 
hands and arms could hardly have become perfect 
enough to have manufactured weapons, or to have 
hurled stones and spears with a true aim, as long as 
they were habitually used for locomotion and for 
supporting the whole weight of the body, or, as before 
remarked, so long as they were especially fitted for 
climbing trees. Such rough treatment would also 
have blunted the sense of touch, on which their 
delicate use largely depends. From these causes alone 
it would have been an advantage to man to become a 
biped; but for many actions it is indispensable that 
the arms and whole upper part of the body should be 
free ; and he must for this end stand firmly on his 
feet. To gain this great advantage, the feet have been 
rendered flat; and the great toe has been peculiarly 
modifled, though this has entailed the almost complete 
loss of its power of prehension. It accords with the 
principle of the division of physiological labour, pre- 
vailing throughout the animal kingdom, that as the 
hands became perfected for prehension, the feet should 
have become perfected for support and locomotion. 
With some savages, however, the foot has not 
altogether lost its prehensile power, as shewn by 
their manner of climbing trees, and of using them in 
other ways.'^

If it be an advantage to man to stand firmly on his 
feet and to have his hands and arms free, of which, 
from his pre-eminent success in the battle of life 
there can be no doubt, then I can see no reason why it 
should not have been advantageous to the progenitors 
of man to have become more and more erect or bipedal. 
They would thus have been better able to defend 
themselves with stones or clubs, to attack their prey, 
or otherwise to obtain food. The best built individuals 
would in the long run have succeeded best, and have 
survived in larger numbers. If the gorilla and a few 
allied forms had become extinct, it might have been 
argued, with great force and apparent truth, that an 
animal could not have been gradually converted from a 
quadruped into a biped, as all the individuals in an 
intermediate condition would have been miserably 
iil-fitted for progression. But we know (and this is 
well worthy of reflection) that the anthropomorphous 
apes are now actually in an intermediate condition ; 
and no one doubts that they are on the whole well 
adapted for their conditions of life. Thus the gorilla 
runs with a sidelong shambling gait, but more 
commonly progresses by resting on its bent hands. 
The long-armed apes occasionally use their arms like 
crutches, swinging their bodies forward between them, 
and some kinds of Hylobates, without having been 
taught, can walk or run upright with tolerable quick- 
ness ; yet they move awkwardly, and much less 
securely than man. We see, in short, in existing

monkeys a manner of progression intermediate between 
that of a quadruped and a biped ; but, as an un- 
prejudiced judge’® insists, the anthropomorphous apes 
approach in structure more nearly to the bipedal than 
to the quadrupedal type. 

As the progenitors of man became more and more 
erect, with their hands and arms more and more 
modified for prehension and other purposes, with their 
feet and legs at the same time transformed for firm 
support and progression, endless other changes of 
structure would have become necessary. The pelvis 
would have to be broadened, the spine peculiarly 
curved, and the head fixed in an altered position, all 
which changes have been attained by man. Prof. 
Schaaff hausen’® maintains that “the powerful mastoid 
“ processes of the human skull are the result of his 
“ erect position ; ” and these processes are absent in 
the orang, chimpanzee, &c., and are smaller in the 
gorilla than in man. Various other structures, which 
appear connected with man’s erect position, might 
here have been added. It is very difficult to decide 
how far these correlated modifications are the result of 
natural selection, and how far of the inherited efi’ects 
of the increased use of certain parts, or of the action 
of one part on another. No doubt these means of 
change often co-operate : thus when certain muscles, 
and the crests of bone to which they are attached, 
become enlarged by habitual use, this shews that

certain actions are habitually performed and must bo 
serviceable. Hence the individuals which performed 
them best, would tend to survive in greater numbers. 

The free use of the arms and hands, partly the 
' cause and partly the result of man’s erect position, 
appears to have led in an indirect manner to other 
modifications of structure. The early male forefathers 
of man were, as previously stated, probably furnished 
with great canine teeth ; bnt as they gradually ac- 
quired the habit of using stones, clubs, or other 
weapons, for fighting with their enemies or rivals, 
they would use their jaws and teeth less and less. In 
this case, the jaws, together with the teeth, would 
become reduced in size, as we may feel almost sure 
from innumerable analogous cases. In a future 
chapter we shall meet with a closely parallel case, in 
the reduction or complete disappearance of the canine 
teeth in male ruminants, apparently in relation with 
the development of their horns; and in horses, in 
relation to their habit of fighting with their incisor 
teeth and hoofs. 

In the adult male anthropomorphous apes, as 
Kiitimeyer,^’ and others, have insisted, it is the effect 
on the skull of the great development of the jaw- 
muscles that causes it to differ so greatly in many 
respects from that of man, and has given to these 
animals “ a truly frightful physiognomy.” Therefore, 
as the jaws and teeth in man’s progenitors gradually 
become reduced in size, the adult skull would have 
come to resemble more and more that of existing man. 
As we shall hereafter see, a great reduction of the

Lchre,’ 1868. s. 51,

81 


canine teeth in the males would almost certainly affect 
the teeth of the females through inheritance. 

As the various mental faculties gradually developed 
themselves the brain would almost certainly become 
larger. No one, I presume, doubts that the • large 
proportion which the size of man’s brain bears to his 
body, compared to the same proportion in the gorilla 
or orang, is closely connected with his higher mental 
powers. We meet with closely analogous facts with 
insects, for in ants the cerebral ganglia are of extra- 
ordinary dimensions, and in all the Hymenoptera these 
ganglia are many times larger than in the less 
intelligent orders, such as beetles.’® On the other 
hand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two 
animals or of any two men can be accurately gauged 
by the cubic contents of their skulls. It is certain 
that there may be extraordinary mental activity with 
an extremely small absolute mass of nervous matter: 
thus the wonderfully diversified instincts, mental 
powers, and affections of ants are notorious, yet their 
cerebral ganglia are not so large as the quarter of a 
small pin’s head. Under this point of view, the brain 
of an ant is one of the most marvellous atoms of 
matter in the world, perhaps more so than the brain 
of a man. 

The belief that there exists in man some close 
relation between the size of the brain and the develop- 
ment of the intellectual faculties is supported by the 
comparison of the skulls of savage and civilised races,

of ancient and modern people, and by the analogy of 
the whole vertebrate series. Dr. J. Barnard Davis 
has proved,’® by many careful measurements, that the 
mean internal capacity of the skull in Europeans is 
92*3 cubic inches; in Americans 87 ’5; in Asiatics 
87 • 1 ; and in Australians only 81 * 9 cubic inches. 
Professor Broca®® found that the nineteenth century 
skulls from graves in Paris were larger than those 
from vaults of the twelfth century, in the proportion of 
1484 to 1426 ; and that the increased size, as ascer- 
tained by measurements, was exclusively in the frontal 
part of the skull — the seat of the intellectual faculties. 
Prichard is persuaded that the present inhabitants of 
Britain have “ much more capacious brain-cases ” than 
the ancient inhabitants. Nevertheless, it must be 
admitted that some skulls of very high antiquity, such 
as the famous one of Neanderthal, are well developed 
and capacious.®^ With respect to the lower animals, 
M. E. Lartet,®^ by comparing the crania of tertiary 
and recent mammals belonging to the same groups, 
has come to the remarkable conclusion that the brain

In the interesting article 
just referred to. Prof. Broca has 
well remarked, that in civilised 
nations, the average capacity of 
the skull must be lowered by 
the ])rcservation of a consider- 
able number of individuals, weak 


in mind and body, who would 
have been promptly eliminated 
in the savage state. On the 
other hand, with savages, the 
average includes only the more 
capable individuals, who have 
been able to survive under ex- 
tremely hard conditions of life. 
Broca thus explains the other- 
wise inexplicable fact, that the 
mean capacity of the skull of 
the ancient Troglodytes of Lozere 
is greater than that of modern 
Frenchmen.

ences,’ &c., J une 1, 1868.

is generally larger and the convolutions are more 
complex in the more recent forms. On the other 
hand, I have shewn^® that the brains of domestic 
rabbits are considerably reduced in bulk, in com- 
parison with those of the wild rabbit or hare ; and 
this may he attributed to their having been closely 
confined during many generations, so that they have 
exerted their intellect, instincts, senses and voluntary 
movements hut little. 

The gradually increasing weight of the brain and 
skull in man must have influenced the development of 
the supporting spinal column, more especially whilst he 
was becoming erect. As this change of position was 
being brought about, the internal pressure of the 
brain will also have influenced the form of the skull ; 
for many facts shew how easily the skull is thus 
afi’ected. Ethnologists believe that it is modified by 
the kind of cradle in which infants sleep. Habitual 
spasms of the muscles, and a cicatrix from a severe 
burn, have permanently modified the facial bones. In 
young persons whose heads have become fixed either 
sideways or backwards, owing to disease, one of the 
two eyes has changed its position, and the shape of 
the skull has been altered apparently by the pressure 
of the brain in a new direction.®^ I have shewn that

his own observations, cases of 
the modification of the skull 
from the head being fixed in an 
unnatural position. He believes 
that in certain trades, such as 
that of a shoemaker, where the 
head is habitually held forward, 
the forehead becomes more 
rounded and prominent.

with long-eared rabbits even so trilling a cause as the 
lopping forward of one ear drags forward almost every 
bone of the skull on that side ; so that the bones on 
the opposite side no longer strictly correspond. 
Lastly, if any animal were to increase or diminish 
much in general size, without any change in its 
mental powers, or if the mental powers were to be 
much increased or diminished, without any great 
change in the size of the body, the shape of the skull 
would almost certainly be altered. I infer this from 
my observations on domestic rabbits, some kinds of 
which have become very much larger than the wild 
animal, whilst others have retained nearly the same 
size, but in both cases the brain has been much 
reduced relatively to the size of the body. Now I was 
at first much surprised on finding that in all these 
rabbits the skull had become elongated or dolichoce- 
phalic ; for instance, of two skulls of nearly equal 
breadth, the one from a wild rabbit and the other 
from a large domestic kind, the former was 3 * 15 and 
the latter 4*3 inches in length.®® One of the most 
marked distinctions in different races of men is that 
the skull in some is elongated, and in others rounded ; 
and here the explanation suggested by the case of the 
rabbits may hold good; for Welcker finds that short 

men incline more to biachycephaly, and tall men to 
“ dolichocephaly ; ” and tall men may be compared 
with the larger and longer-bodied rabbits, all of which 
have elongated skulls, or are dolichocephalic.

From these several facts we can understand, to a 
certain extent, the means by which the great size and 
more or less rounded form of the skull have been 
acquired by man ; and these are characters eminently 
distinctive of him in comparison with the lower 
animals. 

Another most conspicuous difference between man 
and the lower animals is the nakedness of his skin. 
Whales and porpoises (Cetacea), dugongs (Sirenia) and 
the hippopotamus are naked ; and this may be advan- 
tageous to them for gliding through the water ; nor 
would it he injurious to them from the loss of warmth, 
as the species, which inhabit the colder regions, are 
protected by a thick layer of blubber, serving the 
same purpose as the fur of seals and otters. Elephants 
and rhinoceroses are almost hairless; and as certain 
extinct species, which formerly lived under an Arctic 
climate, were covered with long wool or hair, it would 
almost appear as if the existing species of both genera 
had lost their hairy covering from exposure to heat 
This appears the more probable, as the elephants in 
India which live on elevated and cool districts are more 
hairy®’ than those on the lowlands. May we then 
infer that man became divested of hair from having 
aboriginally inhabited some tropical land ? That the 
hair is chiefly retained in the male sex on the chest 
and face, and in both sexes at the junction of all four 
limbs with the trunk, favours this inference— on the 
assumption that the hair was lost before man became 
erect ; for the parts which now retain most hair would 
then have been most protected from the heat of the 
sun. The crown of the head, however, offers a curious

exception, for at all times it must have been one of the 
most exposed parts, yet it is thickly clothed with hair. 
The fact, however, that the other members of the order 
of Primates, to which man belongs, although inhabiting 
various hot regions, are well clothed with hair, generally 
thickest on the upper surface,^® is opposed to the sup- 
position that man became naked through the action of 
the sun. Mr. Belt believes that within the tropics it 
is an advantage to man to be destitute of hair, as he is 
thus enabled to free himself of the multitude of ticks 
(acari) and other parasites, with which he is often 
infested, and which sometimes cause ulceration. But 
whether this evil is of sufficient magnitude to have led 
to the denudation of his body through natural selection, 
may be doubted, since none of the many quadrupeds 
inhabiting the tropics have, as far as I know, acquired 
any specialised means of relief. The view which seems 
to me the most probable is that man, or rather 
primarily woman, became divested of hair for orna- 
mental purposes, as we shall see under Sexual Selection ; 
and, according to this belief, it is not surprising that 
man should differ so greatly in hairiness from all other 
Primates, for characters, gained through sexual selec-

tion, often differ to an extraordinary degree in closely 
related forms. 

According to a popular impression, the absence of a 
tail is eminently distinctive of man ; but as those apes 
which come nearest to him are destitute of this organ, 
its disappearance does not relate exclusively to man. 
The tail often differs remarkably in length within the 
same genus: thus in some species of Macacus it is 
longer than the whole body, and is formed of twenty- 
four vertebrae ; in others it consists of a scarcely visible 
stump, containing only three or four vertebrae. In 
some kinds of baboons there are twenty-five, whilst in 
the mandrill there are ten very small stunted caudal 
vertebrae, or, according to Cuvier,®® sometimes only 
five. The tail, whether it be long or short, almost 
always tapers towards the end ; and this, I presume, 
results from the atrophy of the terminal muscles, 
together with their arteries and nerves, through disuse, 
leading to the atrophy of the terminal bones. But no 
explanation can at present he given of the great 
diversity which often occurs in its length. Here, 
however, we are more specially concerned with the 
complete external disappearance of the tail. Professor 
Broca has recently shewn that the tail in all quadru- 
peds consists of two portions, generally separated 
abruptly from each other ; the basal portion consists 
of vertebrae, more or less perfectly channelled and 
furnished with apophyses like ordinary vertebrae ; 
whereas those of the terminal portion are not chan-

nelled, are almost smooth, and scarcely resemble true 
vertebrae. A tail, though not externally visible, is 
really present in man and the anthropomorphous apes, 
and is constructed on exactly the same pattern in both. 
In the terminal portion the vertebrae, constituting the 
os coccijx, are quite rudimentary, being much reduced in 
size and number. In the basal portion, the vertebrae 
are likewise few, are united firmly together, and are 
arrested in development ; hut they have been rendered 
much broader and flatter than the corresponding ver- 
tebrae in the tails of other animals : they constitute 
what Broca calls the accessory sacral vertebrae. These 
are of functional importance by supporting certain 
internal parts and in other ways ; and their modifica- 
tion is directly connected with the erect or semi-erect 
attitude of man and the anthropomorphous apes. This 
conclusion is the more trustworthy, as Broca formerly 
held a different view, which he has now abandoned. 
The modification, therefore, of the basal caudal ver- 
tebras in man and the higher apes may have been 
effected, directly or indirectly, through natural selec- 
tion. 

But what are we to say about the rudimentary and 
variable vertebrae of the terminal portion of the tail, 
forming the os coccyx ? A notion which has often been, 
and will no doubt again he ridiculed, namely, that 
fiiction has had something to do with the disappear- 
ance of the external portion of the tail, is not so 
ridiculous as it at first appears. Dr. Anderson^^ states 
that the extremely short tail of Macacus hrunneus is 
formed of eleven vertebrae, including the imbedded 
basal ones. The extremity is tendinous and contains 
‘ Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,’ 1872, p. 210. 


Chap. II.

no vertebrae; this is succeeded by live rudimentary 
ones, so minute that together they are only one line 
and a half in length, and these are permanently bent 
to one side in the shape of a hook. The free part of 
the tail, only a little above an inch in length, includes 
only four more small vertebrae. This short tail is 
carried erect ; but about a quarter of its total length is 
doubled on to itself to the left ; and this terminal part, 
which includes the hook-like portion, serves to fill up 
‘‘ the interspace between the upper divergent portion 
‘ of the calosities ; ” so that the animal sits on it, and 
thus renders it rough and callous. Dr. Anderson thus 
sums up his observations : “ These facts seem to me to 
“ have only one explanation ; this tail, from its short 
“ size, is in the monkey’s way when it sits down, and 
“ frequently becomes placed under the animal while it 
“ is in this attitude ; and from the circumstance that 
“ it does not extend beyond the extremity of the ischial 
“ tuberosities, it seems as if the tail originally had been 
“ bent round by the will of the animal, into the inter - 
“ space between the callosities, to escape being pressed 
“ between them and the ground, and that in time the 
“ curvature became permanent, fitting in of itself when 
“ the organ happens to be sat upon.” Under these 
circumstances it is not surprising that the surface of 
the tail should have been roughened and rendered 
callous, and Dr. Murie,^^ who carefully observed this 
species in the Zoological Gardens, as well as three 
other closely allied forms with slightly longer tails, 
says that when the animal sits down, the tail “ is 
“ necessarily thrust to one side of the buttocks ; and 
“ whether long or short its root is consequently liable

to be nibbed or chafed.” As we now have evidence 
that mutilations occasionally produce an inherited 
effect, it is not very improbable that in short-tailed 
monkeys, the projecting part of the tail, being function- 
ally useless, should after many generations have 
become rudimentary and distorted, from being con- 
tinually rubbed and chafed. We see the projecting 
part in this condition in the Macacus hrunneus, and 
absolutely aborted in the M. ecaudatus and in several 
of the higher apes. Finally, then, as far as we can 
judge, the tail has disappeared in man and the anthro- 
pomorphous apes, owing to the terminal portion having 
been injured by friction during a long lapse of time ; 
the basal and embedded portion having been reduced 
and modified, so as to become suitable to the erect or 
semi-erect position. 


I have now endeavoured to shew that some of the 
most distinctive characters of man have in all proba- 
bility been acquired, either directly, or more commonly 
indirectly, through natural selection. We should bear 
in mind that modifications in structure or constitution 
which do not serve to adapt an organism to its habits 
of life, to the food which it consumes, or passively to 
the surrounding conditions, cannot have been thus 
acquired. We must not, however, be too confident in 
deciding what modifications are of service to each 

I allude to Dr. Brown- have occasion to refer to Mr. 
Sequard’s observations on the Salvin’s interesting case of the 
transmitted effect of an opeia- apparently inherited effects of 
tion causing epilepsy in guinea- mot-mots biting off the barbs of

being : we should remember how little we know about 
the use of many parts, or what changes in the blood 
or tissues may serve to fit an organism for a new 
climate or new kinds of food. Nor must we forget the 
principle of correlation, by which, as Isidore Geoffroy 
has shewn in the case of man, many strange deviations 
of structure are tied together. Independently of 
correlation, a change in one part often leads, through 
the increased or decreased use of other parts, to other 
changes of a quite unexpected nature. It is also well 
to reflect on such facts, as the wonderful growth of 
galls on plants caused by the poison of an insect, and 
on the remarkable changes of colour in the plumage of 
parrots when fed on certain fishes, or inoculated with 
the poison of toads for we can thus see that the 
fluids of the system, if altered for some special purpose, 
might induce other changes. We should especially 
bear in mind that modifications acquired and continually 
used during past ages for some useful purpose, would 
probably become firmly fixed, and might be long- 
inherited. 

Thus a large yet undefined extension may safely be 
given to the direct and indirect results of natural 
selection ; but I now admit, after reading the essay by 
Nageli on plants, and the remarks by various authors 
with respect to animals, more especially those recently 
made by Professor Broca, that in the earlier editions 
of my ‘Origin of Species’ I perhaps attributed too 
much to the action of natural selection or the survival 
of the fittest. I have altered the fifth edition of the 
‘ Origin ’ so as to confine my remarks to adaptive 

‘The Variation of xVniraa's and Plants under Domestication,’

Pakt I. 


changes of structure ; but I am convinced, from the 
light gained during even the last few years, that very 
many structures which now appear to us useless, will 
hereafter he proved to be useful, and will therefore 
come within the range of natural selection. Neverthe- 
less, I did not formerly consider sufficiently the 
existence of structures, which, as far as we can at 
present judge, are neither beneficial nor injurious ; and 
this I believe to be one of the greatest oversights as 
yet detected in my work. I may be permitted to say, 
as some excuse, that I had tw^o distinct objects in view ; 
firstly, to shew that species had not been separately 
created, and secondly, that natural selection had been 
the chief agent of change, though largely aided by the 
inherited effects of habit, and slightly by the direct 
action of the surrounding conditions. I was not, how- 
ever, able to annul the influence of my former belief, 
then almost universal, that each species had been 
purposely created ; and this led to my tacit assumption 
that every detail of structure, excepting rudiments, 
was of some special, though unrecognised, service. 
Any one with this assumption in his mind would 
- naturally extend too far the action of natural selection, 
either during past or present times. Some of those 
who admit the principle of evolution, but reject natural 
selection, seem to forget, when criticising my book, that 
I had the above two objects in view ; hence if I have 
erred in giving to natural selection great power, which 
1 am very far from admitting, or in having exaggerated 
its power, which is in itself probable, I have at least, 
as I hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the 
dogma of separate creations. 

It is, as I can now see, probable that all organic 


Chap. II. 


MANNER OF DEVELOPMENT. 


93 


beings, including man, possess peculiarities of structure, 
which neither are now, nor were formerly of any 
service to them, and which, therefore, are of no physio- 
logical importance. We know not what produces the 
numberless slight differences between the individuals 
of each species, for reversion only carries the problem 
a few steps backwards, but each peculiarity must have 
had its efficient cause. If these causes, whatever they 
may be, were to act more uniformly and energetic- 
ally during a lengthened period (and against this no 
reason can be assigned), the result would probably be 
not a mere slight individual difference, but a well- 
marked and constant modification, though one of no 
physiological importance. Changed structures, which 
are in no way beneficial, cannot be kept uniform 
through natural selection, though the injurious will be 
thus eliminated. Uniformity of chaiacter would, how- 
ever, naturally follow from the assumed uniformity of 
the exciting causes, and likewise from the free inter- 
crossing of many individuals. During successive 
periods, the same organism might in this manner 
acquire successive modifications, which would be trans- 
mitted in a nearly uniform state as long as the exciting 
causes remained the same and there was free inter- 
crossing. With respect to the exciting causes we can 
only say, as when speaking of so-called spontaneous 
variations, that they relate much more closely to the 
constitution of the varying organism, than to the 
nature of the conditions to which it has been subjected. 

Conclusion . — In this chapter we have seen that as 
man at the present day is liable, like every other 
animal, to multiform individual differences or slight

variations, so no doubt were the early progenitors of 
man ; the variations being formerly induced by the 
same general causes, and governed by the same general 
and complex laws as at present. As all animals tend 
to multiply beyond their means of subsistence, so it 
must have been with the progenitors of man ; and this 
would inevitably lead to a struggle for existence and 
to natural selection. The latter process would be 
greatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased 
use of parts, and these two processes would incessantly 
react on each other. It appears, also, as we shall 
hereafter see, that various unimportant characters have 
been acquired by man through sexual selection. An 
unexplained residuum of change must be left to the 
assumed uniform action of those unknown agencies, 
which occasionally induce strongly marked and abrupt 
deviations of structure in our domestic productions. 

Judging from the habits of savages and of the 
greater number of the Quadrumana, primeval men, and 
even their ape-like progenitors, probably lived in 
society. With strictly social animals, natural selection 
sometimes acts on the individual, through the pre- 
servation of variations which are beneficial to the 
community. A community which includes a large 
number of well -endowed individuals increases in 
number, and is victorious over other less favoured ones ; 
even although each separate member gains no advantage 
over the others of the same community. Associated 
insects have thus acquired many remarkable structures, 
which are of little or no service to the individual, such 
as the pollen-collecting apparatus, or the sting of the 
worker-bee, or the great jaws of soldier-ants. With 
the higher social animals, I am not aware that any 


Chap. II

95 


structure has been modified solely for the good of the 
community, though some are of secondary service to it. 
For instance, the horns of ruminants and the great 
canine teeth of baboons appear to have been acquired 
by the males as weapons for sexual strife, but they are 
used in defence of the herd or troop. In regard to 
certain mental powers the case, as we shall see in the 
fifth chapter, is wholly different ; for these faculties 
have been chiefly, or even exclusively, gained for the 
benefit of the community, and the individuals thereof 
have at the same time gained an advantage indirectly. 

It has often been objected to such views as the fore- 
going, that man is one of the most helpless and 
defenceless creatures in the world ; and that during 
his early and less well-developed condition, he would 
have been still more helpless. The Duke of Argyll, for 
instance, insists that “ the human frame has diverged 
“ from the structure of brutes, in the direction of 
‘‘ greater physical helplessness and weakness. That is 

to say, it is a divergence which of all others it is 
“ most impossible to ascribe to mere natural selection.” 
He adduces the naked and unprotected state of the 
body, the absence of great teeth or claws for defence, 
the small strength and speed of man, and his slight 
power of discovering food or of avoiding danger by 
smell. To these deficiencies there might be added one 
still more serious, namely, that he cannot climb quickly, 
and so escape from enemies. The loss of hair would 
not have been a great injury to the inhabitants of a 
a warm country. For we know that the unclothed 
Fuegians can exist under a wretched climate. When

Part 1 


we compare the defenceless state of man with that of 
apes, we must remember that the great canine teeth 
with which the latter are provided, are possessed in 
their full development by the males alone, and are 
chiefly used by them for fighting with their rivals ; yet 
the females, which are not thus provided, manage to 
survive. 

In regard to bodily size or strength, we do not know 
whether man is descended from some small species, 
like the chimpanzee, or from one as powerful as the 
gorilla ; and, therefore, we cannot say whether man 
has become larger and stronger, or smaller and weaker, 
than his ancestors. We should, however, bear in mind 
than an animal possessing great size, strength, and 
ferocity, and which, like the gorilla, could defend itself 
from all enemies, would not perhaps have become 
social : and this would most effectually have checked 
the acquirement of the higher mental qualities, such 
as sympathy and the love of his fellows. Hence it 
might have been an immense advantage to man to have 
sprung from some comparatively weak creature. 

The small strength and speed of man, his want of 
natural weapons, &c., are more than counterbalanced, 
firstly, by his intellectual powers, through which he 
has formed for himself weapons, tools, &c., though still 
remaining in a barbarous state, and, secondly, by his 
social qualities which lead him to give and receive aid 
from his fellow-men. No country in the world abounds 
in a greater degree with dangerous beasts than 
Southern Africa; no country presents more fearful 
physical hardships than the Arctic regions ; yet one of 
the puniest of races, that of the Bushmen, maintains 
itself in Southern Africa, as do the dwarfed Esquimaux

in the Arctic regions. The ancestors of man were, no 
doubt, inferior in intellect, and probably in social dis- 
position, to the lowest existing savages ; but it is quite 
conceivable that they might have existed, or even 
flourished, if they had advanced in intellect, whilst 
gradually losing their brute-like powers, such as that 
of climbing trees, &c. But these ancestors would not 
have been exposed to any special danger, even if far 
more helpless and defenceless than any existing savages, 
had they inhabited some warm continent or large 
island, such as Australia, New Guinea, or Borneo, which 
is now the home of the orang. And natural selection 
arising from the competition of tribe with tribe, in 
some such large area as one of these, together with the 
inherited effects of habit, would, under favourable 
conditions, have sufficed to raise man to his present 
high position in the organic scale.

Comparison of the Mental Powers of Man and the 
Lower Animals. 

The difference in mental power between the highest ape and the 
lowest savage, immense — Certain instincts in common — The

We liave seen in the last two chapters that man bears 
in his bodily structure clear traces of his descent from 
some lower form; but it may be urged that, as man 
differs so greatly in his mental power from all other 
animals, there must be some error in this conclusion. 
No doubt the difference in this respect is enormous, 
even if we compare the mind of one of the lowest 
savages, who has no words to express any number 
higher than four, and who uses hardly any abstract 
terms for common objects or for the affections,^ with 
that of the most highly organised ape. The difference 
would, no doubt, still remain immense, even if one of 
the higher apes had been improved or civilised as much 
as a dog has been in comparison with its parent-form, 
the wolf or jackal. The Fuegians rank amongst the 
lowest barbarians ; but I was continually struck with

surprise how closely the three natives on board H.M.S. 
“ Beagle,” who had lived some years in England, and 
could talk a little English, resembled us in disposition 
and in most of our mental faculties. If no organic 
being excepting man had possessed any mental power, 
or if his powers had been of a wholly different nature 
from those of the lower animals, then we should never 
have been able to convince ourselves that our high 
faculties had been gradually developed. But it can he 
shewn that there is no fundamental difference of this 
kind. We must also admit that there is a much wider 
interval in mental power between one of the lowest 
fishes, as a lamprey or lancelet, and one of the higher 
apes, than between an ape and man ; yet this interval 
is filled up by numberless gradations. 

Nor is the difference slight in moral disposition 
between a barbarian, such as the man described by the 
old navigator Byron, who dashed his child on the rocks 
for dropping a basket of sea-urchins, and a Howard or 
Clarkson ; and in intellect, between a savage who uses 
hardly any abstract terms, and a Newton or Shakspeare 
Differences of this kind between the highest men of 
the highest races and the lowest savages, are connected 
by the finest gradations. Therefore it is possible that 
they might pass and be developed into each other. 

My object in this chapter is to shew that there is no 
fundamental difference between man and the higher 
mammals in their mental faculties. Each division of 
the subject might have been extended into a separate 
essay, but mus't here be treated briefly. As no classi- 
fication of the mental powers has been universally 
accepted, I shall arrange my remarks in the order most 
convenient for my purpose ; and will select those facts

which have struck me most, with the hope that they 
may produce some effect on the reader. 

With respect to animals very low in the scale, I shall 
give some additional facts under Sexual Selection, 
shewing that their mental powers are much higher 
than might have been expected. The variability of 
the faculties in the individuals of the same species is 
an important point for us, and some few illustrations 
will here be given. But it would be superfluous to 
enter into many details on this head, for I have found 
on frequent enquiry, that it is the unanimous opinion 
of all those who have long attended to animals of many 
kinds, including birds, that the individuals differ 
greatly in every mental characteristic. In what 
manner the mental powers were first developed in the 
lowest organisms, is as hopeless an enquiry as how life 
itself first originated. These are problems for the 
distant future, if they are ever to be solved by man. 

As man possesses the same senses as the lower 
animals, his fundamental intuitions must be the same. 
Man has also some few instincts in common, as that of 
self-preservation, sexual love, the love of the mother 
for her new-born offspring, the desire possessed by the 
latter to suck, and so forth. But man, perhaps, has 
somewhat fewer instincts than those possessed by the 
animals which come next to him in the series. The 
orang in the Eastern islands, and the chimpanzee in 
Africa, build platforms on which they sleep ; and, as 
both species follow the same habit, it might be argued 
that this was due to instinct, but we cannot feel sure 
that it is not the result of both animals having similar 
wants, and possessing similar powers of reasoning. 
These apes, as we may assume, avoid the many 


Chap. IH.

101 


poisonous fruits of the tropics, and man has no such 
knowledge : but as our domestic animals, when taken 
to foreign lands, and when first turned out in the 
spring, often eat poisonous herbs, which they after- 
wards avoid, we cannot feel sure that the apes do not 
learn from their own experience or from that of their 
parents what fruits to select. It is, however, certain, 
as we shall presently see, that apes have an instinctive 
dread of serpents, and probably of other dangerous 
animals. 

The fewness and .the comparative simplicity of the 
instincts in the higher animals are remarkable in 
contrast with those of the lower animals. Cuvier 
maintained that instinct and intelligence stand in an 
inverse ratio to each other ; and some have thought 
that the intellectual faculties of the higher animals 
have been gradually developed from their instincts. 
But Pouchet, in an interesting essay, ^ has shewn that 
no such inverse ratio really exists. Those insects 
which possess the most wonderful instincts are certainly 
the most intelligent. In the vertebrate series, the 
least intelligent members, namely fishes and amphibians, 
do not possess complex instincts ; and amongst mam- 
mals the animal most remarkable for its instincts, 
namely the beaver, is highly intelligent, as will be 
admitted by every one who has read Mr. Morgan’s 
excellent work.^ 

Although the first dawnings of intelligence, accord- 
ing to Mr. Herbert Spencer,^ have been developed 
through the multiplication and co-ordination of reflex

actions, and although many of the simpler instincts 
graduate into reflex actions, and can hardly he dis- 
tinguished from them, as in the case of young animals 
sucking, yet the more complex instincts seem to have 
.originated independently of intelligence. I am, how- 
ever, very far from wishing to deny that instinctive 
actions may lose their fixed and untaught character, 
and he replaced by others performed by the aid of the 
free will. On the other hand, some intelligent actions, 
after being performed during several generations, 
become converted into instincts and are inherited, as 
when birds on oceanic islands learn to avoid man. 
These actions may then be said to be degraded in 
character, for they are no longer performed through 
reason or from experience. But the greater number of 
the more complex instincts appear to have been gained 
in a wholly different manner, through the natural 
selection of variations of simpler instinctive actions. 
Such variations appear to arise from the same unknown 
causes acting on the cerebral organisation, which 
induce slight variations or individual differences in 
other parts of the body ; and these variations, owing 
to our ignorance, are often said to arise spontaneously. 
We can, I think, come to no other conclusion with 
respect to the origin of the more complex instincts, 
when we reflect on the marvellous instincts of sterile 
worker-ants and bees, which leave no offspring to 
inherit the effects of experience and of modified habits. 

Although, as we learn from the above-mentioned 
insects and the heaver, a high degree of intelligence is 
certainly compatible with complex instincts, and 
although actions, at first learnt voluntarily can soon 
through habit be performed with the quickness and 


Chap. III.

103 


certainty of a reflex action, yet it is not improbable 
that there is a certain amount of interference between 
the development of free intelligence and of instinct, — 
which latter implies some inherited modification of the 
brain. Little is known about the functions of the 
brain, but we can perceive that as the intellectual 
powers become highly developed, the various parts of 
the brain must be connected by very intricate channels 
of the freest intercommunication ; and as a consequence 
each separate part would perhaps tend to be less well 
fitted to answer to particular sensations or associations 
in a definite and inherited — that is instinctive — manner. 
There seems even to exist some relation between a low 
degree of intelligence and a strong tendency to the 
formation of fixed, though not inherited habits ; for as 
a sagacious physician remarked to me, persons who are 
slightly imbecile tend to act in everything by routine 
or habit ; and they are rendered much happier if this is 
encouraged. 

I have thought this digression worth giving, because 
we may easily underrate the mental powers of the 
higher animals, and especially of man, when we com- 
pare their actions founded on the memory of past 
events, on foresight, reason, and imagination, with 
exactly similar actions instinctively performed by the 
lower animals ; in this latter case the capacity of per- 
forming such actions has been gained, step by step, 
through the variability of the mental organs and 
natural selection, without any conscious intelligence on 
the part of the animal during each successive genera- 
tion. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has argued,® much of 

* ‘ Oontributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,* 1870, 

p. 212. 


10 i THE DESCENT OF MAN. Past I. 

the intelligent work done by man is due to imitation 
and not to reason ; but there is this great difference 
between his actions and many of those performed by 
the lower animals, namely, that man cannot, on his 
first trial, make, for instance, a stone hatchet or a canoe, 
through his power of imitation. He has to learn his 
work by practice; a beaver, on the other hand, can 
make its dam or canal, and a bird its nest, as well, or 
nearly as well, and a spider its wonderful web, quite as 
well,® the first time it tries as when old and ex- 
perienced. 

To return to our immediate subject : the lower 
animals, like man, manifestly feel pleasure and pain, 
happiness and misery. Happiness is never better 
exhibited than by young animals, such as puppies, 
kittens, lambs, &c., when playing together, like our 
own children. Even insects play together, as has been 
described by that excellent observer, P. Huber,’ who 
saw ants chasing and pretending to bite each other, 
like so many puppies. 

The fact that the lower animals are excited by the 
same emotions as ourselves is so well established, that 
it will not be necessary to weary the reader by many 
details. Terror acts in the same manner on them as 
on us, causing the muscles to tremble, the heart to 
palpitate, the sphincters to be relaxed, and the hair to 
stand on end. Suspicion, the offspring of fear, is 
eminently characteristic of most wild animals. It is, I 
think, impossible to read the account given by Sir E.

Tennent, of the behaviour of the female elephants, used 
as decoys, without admitting that they intentionally 
practise deceit, and well know what they are about. 
Courage and timidity are extremely variable qualities 
in the individuals of the same species, as is plainly seen 
in our dogs. Some dogs and horses are ill-tempered, 
and easily turn sulky ; others are good-tempered ; and 
these qualities are certainly inherited. Every one 
knows how liable animals are to furious rage, and how 
plainly they shew it. Many, and probably true, anec- 
dotes have been published on the long-delayed and 
artful revenge of various animals. The accurate 
Kengger, and Brehm ® state that the American and 
African monkeys which they kept tame, certainly 
revenged themselves. Sir Andrew Smith, a zoologist 
whose scrupulous accuracy was known to many persons, 
told me the following story of which he was himself an 
eye-witness ; at the Cape of Good Hope an officer had 
often plagued a certain baboon, and the animal, seeing 
him approaching one Sunday for parade, poured water 
into a hole and hastily made some thick mud, which he 
skilfully dashed over the officer as^ he passed by, to the 
amusement of many bystanders. For long afterwards 
the baboon rejoiced and triumphed whenever he saw 
his victim. 

The love of a dog for his master is notorious ; as an 
old writer quaintly says,® “ A dog is the only thing on 
“ this earth that luvs you more than he luvs himself.”

THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part I. 


In the agony of death a dog has been known to 
caress his master, and every one has heard of the dog 
suffering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the 
operator; this man, unless the operation was fully 
justified by an increase of our knowledge, or unless he 
had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last 
hour of his life. 

As Whewell has well asked, who that reads the 
“ touching instances of maternal affection, related so 
‘‘ often of the women of all nations, and of the females 
“ of all animals, can doubt that the principle of action 
“is the same in the two cases?” We see maternal 
affection exhibited in the most trifling details; thus 
Kengger observed an American monkey (a Cehus) 
carefully driving away the flies which plagued her 
infant ; and Duvaucel saw a Hylohates washing the 
faces of her young ones in a stream. So intense is the 
grief of female monkeys for the loss of their young, 
that it invariably caused the death of certain kinds 
kept under confinement by Brehm in N. Africa. 
Orphan monkeys were always adopted and carefully 
guarded by the other monkeys, both males and females. 
One female baboon had so capacious a heart that she 
not only adopted young monkeys of other species, but 
stole young dogs and cats, which she continually carried 
about. Her kindness, however, did not go so far as to 
share her food with her adopted offspring, at which 
Brehm was surprised, as his monkeys always divided 
everything quite fairly with their own young ones. 
An adopted kitten scratched this affectionate baboon, 
who certainly had a fine intellect, for she was much 
astonished at being scratched, and immediately ex-

amined the kitten’s feet, and without more ado hit off 
the claws. In the Zoological Gardens, I heard from 
the keeper that an old baboon {G. chacma) had adopted 
a Khesus monkey ; but when a young drill and man- 
drill were placed in the cage, she seemed to perceive 
that these monkeys, though distinct species, were her 
nearer relatives, for she at once rejected the Ehesus 
and adopted both of them. The young Ehesus, as I 
saw, was greatly discontented at being thus rejected, 
and it would, like a naughty child, annoy and attack 
the young drill and mandrill whenever it could- do so 
with safety ; this conduct exciting great indignation in 
the old baboon. Monkeys will also, according to Brehm, 
defend their master when attacked by any one, as well 
as dogs to whom they are attached, from the attacks of 
other dogs. But we here trench on the subjects of 
sympathy and fidelity, to which I shall recur. Some 
of Brehm’s monkeys took much delight in teasing a 
certain old dog whom they disliked, as well as other 
animals, in various ingenious ways. 

Most of the more complex emotions are common to 
the higher animals and ourselves. Every one has seen 
how jealous a dog is of his master’s affection, if lavished 
on any other creature ; and I have observed the same 
fact with monkeys. This shews that animals not only 
love, but have desire to be loved. Animals manifestly 
feel emulation. They love approbation or praise ; and 
a dog carrying a basket for his master exhibits in a 
high degree self-complacency or pride. There can, I

think, be no doubt that a dog feels shame, as distinct 
from fear, and something very like modesty when 
begging too often for food. A great dog scorns the 
snarling of a little dog, and this may be called magna- 
nimity. Several observers have stated that monkeys 
certainly dislike being laughed at ; and they sometimes 
invent imaginary offences. In the Zoological Gardens 
I saw a baboon who always got into a furious rage when 
his keeper took out a letter or book and read it aloud 
to him ; and his rage was so violent that, as I witnessed 
on one occasion, he bit his own leg till the blood flowed. 
Dogs shew what may be fairly called a sense of humour, 
as distinct from mere play ; if a bit of stick or other 
such object be thrown to one, he will often carry it 
away for a short distance; and then squatting down 
with it on the ground close before him, will wait until 
his master comes quite close to take it away. The dog 
will then seize it and rush away in triumph, repeating 
the same manoeuvre, and evidently enjoying the 
practical joke. 

We will now turn to the more intellectual emotions 
and faculties, which are very important, as forming the 
basis for the development of the higher mental powers. 
Animals manifestly enjoy excitement, and suffer from 
ennui, as may be seen with dogs, and, according to 
Eengger, with monkeys. All animals feel Wonder ^ and 
many exhibit Cv/riosity. They sometimes suffer from 
this latter quality, as when the hunter plays antics and 
thus attracts them; I have witnessed this with deer, 
and so it is with the wary chamois, and with some 
kinds of wild-ducks. Brehm gives a curious account 
of the instinctive dread, which his monkeys exhibited, 
for snakes ; but their curiosity was so great that they 


Chap. III.

109 


conld not desist from occasionally satiating their horror 
in a most human fashion, by lifting up the lid of the 
box in which the snakes were kept. I was so much 
surprised at his account, that I took a stuffed and 
coiled-up snake into the monkey-house at the Zoological 
Gardens, and the excitement thus caused was one of the 
most curious spectacles which I ever beheld. Three 
species of Cercopithecus were the most alarmed ; they 
dashed about their cages, and uttered sharp signal cries 
of danger, which were understood by the other mon- 
keys. A few young monkeys and one old Anubis 
baboon alone took no notice of the snake. I then 
placed the stuffed specimen on the ground in one of the 
larger compartments. After a time all the monkeys 
collected round it in a large circle, and staring intently, 
presented a most ludicrous appearance. They became 
extremely ner’vous ; so that when a wooden ball, with 
which they were familiar as a plaything, was acci- 
dentally moved in the straw, under which it was partly 
hidden, they all instantly started away. These monkeys 
behaved very differently when a dead fish, a mouse,^^ a 
living turtle, and other new objects were placed in 
their cages; for though at first frightened, they soon 
approached, handled and examined them. I then 
placed a live snake in a paper bag, with the mouth 
loosely closed, in one of the larger compartments. One 
of the monkeys immediately approached, cautiously 
opened the bag a little, peeped in, and instantly dashed 
away. Then I witnessed what Brehm has described, 
for monkey after monkey, with head raised high and 
turned on one side, could not resist taking a momentary

count of their behaviour on this the Emotioos,’ p. 43.

peep into the upright bag, at the dreadful object lying 
quietly at the bottom. It would almost appear as if 
monkeys had some notion of zoological affinities, for 
those kept by Brehm exhibited a strange, though mis- 
taken, instinctive dread of innocent lizards and frogs. 
An orang, also, has been known to be much alarmed at 
the first sight of a turtle.^^ 

The principle of Imitation is strong in man, and 
especially, as I have myself observed, with savages. 
In certain morbid states of the brain this tendency is 
exaggerated to an extraordinary degree : some hemi- 
plegic patients and others, at the commencement of 
inflammatory softening of the brain, unconsciously 
imitate every word which is uttered, whether in their 
own or in a foreign language, and every gesture or 
action which is performed near them.^* Desor has 
remarked that no animal voluntarily imitates an action 
performed by man, until in the ascending scale we 
come to monkeys, which are well known to he ridiculous 
mockers. Animals, however, sometimes imitate each 
other’s actions : thus two species of wolves, which had 
been reared by dogs, learned to bark, as does sometimes 
the jackal,^® hut whether this can he called voluntary 
imitation is another question. Birds imitate the songs 
of their parents, and sometimes of other birds; and 
parrots are notorious imitators of any sound which they 
often hear. Bureau de la Malle gives an account of

a dog reared by a cat, who learnt to imitate the well- 
known action of a cat licking her paws, and thus 
washing her ears and face ; this was also witnessed by 
the celebrated naturalist Audouin. I have received 
several confirmatory accounts ; in one of these, a dog 
had not been suckled by a cat, but had been brought 
up with one, together with kittens, and had thus 
acquired the above habit, which he ever afterwards 
practised during his life of thirteen years. Bureau de 
la Malle’s dog likewise learnt from the kittens to play 
with a ball by rolling it about with his fore paws, and 
springing on it. A correspondent assures me that a 
cat in his house used to put her paws into jugs of milk 
having too narrow a mouth for her head. A kitten of 
this cat soon learned the same trick, and practised it 
ever afterwards, whenever there was an opportunity. 

The parents of many animals, trusting to the 
principle of imitation in their young, and more 
especially to their instinctive or inherited tendencies, 
may be said to educate them. We see this when a cat 
brings a live mouse to her kittens ; and Bureau de la 
Malle has given a curious account (in the paper above 
quoted) of his observations on hawks which taught 
their young dexterity, as well as judgment of dis- 
tances, by first dropping through the air dead mice 
and sparrows, which the young generally failed to 
catch, and then bringing them live birds and letting 
them loose. 

Hardly any faculty is more important for the in- 
tellectual progress of man than Attention. Animals 
clearly manifest this power, as when a cat watches by 
a hole and prepares to spring on its prey. Wild 
animals sometimes become so absorbed when thus

Pabt L 


engaged, that they may be easily approached. Mr. 
Bartlett has given me a curious proof how variable 
this faculty is in monkeys. A man who trains 
monkeys to act in plays, used to purchase common 
kinds from the Zoological Society at the price of five 
pounds for each ; but he offered to give double the 
price, if he might keep three or four of them for a few 
days, in order to select one. When asked how he 
could possibly learn so soon, whether a particular 
monkey would turn out a good actor, he answered that 
it all depended on their power of attention. If when 
he was talking and explaining anything to a monkey, 
its attention was easily distracted, as by a fly on the 
wall or other trifling object, the case was hopeless. If 
he tried by punishment to make an inattentive monkey 
act, it turned sulky. On the other hand, a monkey 
which carefully attended to him could always be 
trained. 

It is almost superfluous to state that animals have 
excellent Memories for persons and places. A baboon 
at the Cape of Good Hope, as I have been informed by 
Sir Andrew Smith, recognised him with joy after an 
absence of nine months. I had a dog who was savage 
and averse to all strangers, and I purposely tried his 
memory after an absence of five years and two days. 
I went near the stable where he lived, and shouted to 
him in my old manner ; he shewed no joy, but 
instantly followed me out walking, and obeyed me, 
exactly as if I had parted with him only half an hour 
before. A train of old associations, dormant duriog 
five years, had thus been instantaneously awakened in 
his mind. Even ants, as P. Huber has clearly 
‘ lies Moeurs des Pourmis,’ 1810, p. 150. 


Chap. III. 


MENTAL POWEES. 


113 


Bhewn, recognised their fellow-ants belonging to the 
same community after a separation of four months. 
Animals can certainly by some means judge of the 
intervals of time between recurrent events. 

The Imagination is one of the highest prerogatives 
of man. By this faculty he unites former images and 
ideas, independently of the will, and thus creates 
brilliant and novel results. A poet, as Jean Paul 
Kichter remarks,^® “ who must reflect whether he shall 
“ make a character say yes or no — to the devil with 
“ him ; he is only a stupid corpse.” Dreaming gives 
us the best notion of this power ; as Jean Paul again 
says, “ The dream is an involuntary art of poetry.” 
The value of the products of our imagination depends 
of course on the number, accuracy, and clearness of 
our impressions, on our judgment and taste in 
selecting or rejecting the involuntary combinations, 
and to a certain extent on our power of voluntarily 
combining them. As dogs, cats, horses, and probably 
all the higher animals, even birds have vivid dreams, 
and this is shewn by their movements and the sounds 
uttered, we must admit that they possess some power 
of imagination. There must be something special, 
which causes dogs to howl in the night, and especially 
during moonlight, in that remarkable and melancholy 
manner called baying. All dogs do not do so ; and, 
according to Houzeau,^^ they do not then look at the 
moon, but at some fixed point near the horizon.

Houzeau thinks that their imaginations are disturbed 
by the vague outlines of the surrounding objects, and 
conjure up before them fantastic images : if this be so, 
their feelings may almost be called superstitious. 

Of all the faculties of the human mind, it will, I 
presume, be admitted that Reason stands at the 
summit. Only a few persons now dispute that 
animals possess some power of reasoning. Animals 
may constantly be seen to pause, deliberate, and 
resolve. It is a significant fact, that the more the 
habits of any particular animal are studied by a 
naturalist, the more he attributes to reason and the 
less to unlearnt instincts.^^ In future chapters we 
shall see that some animals extremely low in the scale 
apparently display a certain amount of reason. No 
doubt it is often difficult to distinguish between the 
power of reason and that of instinct. For instance, 
Dr. Hayes, in his work on ‘The Open Polar Sea,’ 
repeatedly remarks that his dogs, instead of continuing 
to draw the sledges in a compact body, diverged and 
separated when they came to thin ice, so that their 
weight might be more evenly distributed. This was 
often the first warning which the travellers received 
that the ice was becoming thin and dangerous. Now, 
did the dogs act thus from the experience of each 
individual, or from the example of the older and wiser

parent-stock of the Esquimaux dog, may have acquired 
an instinct impelling them not to attack their prey in 
a close pack, when on thin ice. 

We can only judge by the circumstances under 
which actions are performed, whether they are due to 
instinct, or to reason, or to the mere association of 
ideas : this latter principle, however, is intimately 
connected with reason. A curious case has been given 
by Prof. Mobius,^® of a pike, separated by a plate of 
glass from an adjoining aquarium stocked with fish, 
and who often dashed himself with such violence 
against the glass in trying to catch the other fishes, 
that he was sometimes completely stunned. The pike 
went on thus for three months, but at last learnt 
caution, and ceased to do so. The plate of glass was 
then removed, hut the pike would not attack these 
particular fishes, though he would devour others which 
were afterwards introduced ; so strongly was the idea 
of a violent shock associated in his feeble mind with 
^ the attempt on his former neighbours. If a savage, 
who had never seen a large plate-glass window, were 
to dash himself even once against it, he would for a 
long time afterwards associate a shock with a window- 
frame ; but very diff'erently from the pike, he would 
probably reflect on the nature of the impediment, and 
be cautious under analogous circumstances. Now with 
! monkeys, as we shall presently see, a painful or merely 
a disagreeable impression, from an action once per- 
formed, is sometimes sufficient to prevent the animal 
I from repeating it. If we attribute this difference 

' between the monkey and the pike solely to the 

association of ideas being so much stronger and more

persistent in the one than the other, though the pike 
often received much the more severe injury, can we 
maintain in the case of man that a similar difference 
implies the possession of a fundamentally different 
mind? 

Houzeau relates that, whilst crossing a wide and 
arid plain in Texas, his two dogs suffered greatly from 
thirst, and that between thirty and forty times they 
rushed down the hollows to search for water. These 
hollows were not valleys, and there were no trees in 
them, or any other difference in the vegetation, and as 
they were absolutely dry there could have been no 
smell of damp earth. The dogs behaved as if they 
knew that a dip in the ground offered them the best 
chance of finding water, and Houzeau has often 
witnessed the same behaviour in other animals. 

I have seen, as I daresay have others, that when a 
small object is thrown on the ground beyond the reach 
of one of the elephants in the Zoological Gardens, he 
blows through his trunk on the ground beyond the 
object, so that the current reflected on all sides may 
drive the object within his reach. Again a well- 
known ethnologist, Mr. Westropp, informs me that he 
observed in Vienna a hear deliberately making with 
his paw a current in some water, which was close to 
the bars of his cage, so as to draw a piece of floating 
bread within his reach. These actions of the elephant 
and bear can hardly be attributed to instinct or 
inherited habit, as they would he of little use to an 
animal in a state of nature. Now, what is the 
difference between such actions, when performed by an 
uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals ?

The savage and the dog have often found water at a 
low level, and the coincidence under such circum- 
stances has become associated in their minds. A 
cultivated man would perhaps make some general 
proposition on the subject ; but from all that we 
know of savages it is extremely doubtful whether they 
would do so, and a dog certainly would not. But a 
savage, as well as a dog, would search in the same way, 
though frequently disappointed ; and in both it seems 
to be equally an act of reason, whether or not any 
general proposition on the subject is consciously 
placed before the mind.^® The same would apply to 
the elephant and the bear making currents in the air 
or water. The savage would certainly neither know 
nor care by what law the desired movements were 
effected ; yet his act would be guided by a rude 
process of reasoning, as surely as would a philosopher 
in his longest chain of deductions. There would no 
doubt be this difference between him and one of the 
higher animals, that he would take notice of much 
slighter circumstances and conditions, and would 
observe any connection between them after much less 
experience, and this would be of paramount import- 
ance. I kept a daily record of the actions of one of 
my infants, and when he was about eleven months old, 
and before he could speak a single word, I was con- 
tinually struck with the greater quickness, with which 
all sorts of objects and sounds were associated to-

gether in his mind, compared with that of the most 
intelligent dogs I ever knew. But the higher animals 
differ in exactly the same way in this power of associa- 
tion from those low in the scale, such as the pike, as 
well as in that of drawing inferences and of obser- 
vation. 

The promptings of reason, after very short ex- 
perience, are well shewn by the following actions of 
American monkeys, which stand low in their order. 
Eengger, a most careful observer, states that when he 
first gave eggs to his monkeys in Paraguay, they 
smashed them, and thus lost much of their contents ; 
afterwards they gently hit one end against some hard 
body, and picked off the bits of shell with their fingers. 
After cutting themselves only once with any sharp 
tool, they would not touch it again, or would handle 
it with the greatest caution. Lumps of sugar were 
often given them wrapped up in paper ; and Kengger 
sometimes put a live wasp in the paper, so that in 
hastily unfolding it they got stung ; after this had once 
happened, they always first held the packet to their 
ears to detect any movement within.^® 

The following cases relate to dogs. Mr. Colquhoun^^ 
winged two wild-ducks, which fell on the further side 
of a stream ; his retriever tried to bring over both at 
once, but could not succeed ; she then, though never 
before known to ruftie a feather, deliberately killed 
one, brought over the other, and returned for the dead

bird. Col. Hutchinson relates that two partridges were 
shot at once, one being killed, the other wounded ; the 
latter ran away, and was caught by the retriever, who 
on her return came across the dead bird ; “ she 
“ stopped, evidently greatly puzzled, and after one or 
“ two trials, finding she could not take it up without 
permitting the escape of the winged bird, she con- 
sidered a moment, then deliberately murdered it by 
“ giving it a severe crunch, and afterwards brought 
“ away both together. This was the only known 
“ instance of her ever having wilfully injured any 
“game.” Here we have reason though not quite 
perfect, for the retriever might have brought the 
wounded bird first and then returned for the dead 
one, as in the case of the two wild-ducks. I give the 
above cases, as resting on the evidence of two inde- 
pendent witnesses, and because in both instances the 
retrievers, after deliberation, broke through a habit 
which is inherited by them (that of not killing the 
game retrieved), and because they shew how strong 
their reasoning faculty must have been to overcome a 
fixed habit. 

I will conclude by quoting a remark by the il- 
lustrious Humboldt.^® “ The muleteers in S. America 
“say, ‘I will not give you the mule whose step is 
“ ‘ easiest, but la mas racional , — the one that reasons 
“ ‘ best ; ’ ” and as he adds, “ this popular expression, 
“ dictated by long experience, combats the system of 
“ animated machines, better perhaps than all the argu- 
“ments of speculative philosophy.” Nevertheless 
some writers even yet deny that the higher animals 
possess a trace of reason ; and they endeavour to

explain away, by what appears to be mere verbiage,^® 
all such facts as those above given. 

It has, I think, now been shewn that man and the 
higher animals, especially the Primates, have some few 
instincts in common. All have the same senses, 
intuitions, and sensations, — similar passions, affec- 
tions, and emotions, even the more complex ones, such 
as jealousy, suspicion, emulation, gratitude, and mag- 
nanimity ; they practise deceit and are revengeful ; 
they are sometimes susceptible to ridicule, and even 
have a sense of humour ; they feel wonder and 
curiosity ; they possess the same faculties of imita- 
tion, attention, deliberation, choice, memory, imagina- 
tion, the association of ideas, and reason, though in 
very different degrees. The individuals of the same 
species graduate in intellect from absolute imbecility 
to high excellence. They are also liable to insanity, 
though far less often than in the case of man.®® 
Nevertheless, many authors have insisted that man is 
divided by an insuperable barrier from all the lower 
animals in his mental faculties. I formerly made a 
collection of above a score of such aphorisms, but they

are almost worthless, as their wide difference and 
number prove the difficulty, if not the impossibility, 
of the attempt. It has been asserted that man alone 
is capable of progressive improvement ; that he alone 
makes use of tools or fire, domesticates other animals, 
or possesses property ; that no animal has the power 
of abstraction, or of forming general concepts, is self- 
conscious and comprehends itself; that no animal 
employs language ; that man alone has a sense of 
beauty, is liable to caprice, has the feeling of gratitude, 
mystery, &c. ; believes in Grod, or is endowed with a 
conscience. I will hazard a few remarks on the more 
important and interesting of these points. 

Archbishop Sumner formerly maintained that man 
alone is capable of progressive improvement. That he 
is capable of incomparably greater and more rapid 
improvement than is any other animal, admits of no 
dispute; and this is mainly due to his power of 
speaking and handing down his acquired knowledge. 
With animals, looking first to the individual, every 
one who has had any experience in setting traps, 
knows that young animals can be caught much more 
easily than old ones; and they can be much more 
easily approached by an enemy. Even with respect 
to old animals, it is impossible to catch many in the 
same place and in the same kind of trap, or to destroy 
them by the same kind of poison ; yet it is improbable 
that all should have partaken of the poison, and 
impossible that all should have been caught in a trap. 
They must learn caution by seeing' their brethren 
caught or poisoned. In North America, where the fur- 
bearing animals have long been pursued, they exhibit, 
“ Quoted by Sir C. Lyell, ‘ Antiquity of Man,* p. 497. 


122 


THE DESCENT OF MAN

according to the unanimous testimony of all observers, 
an almost incredible amount of sagacity, caution and 
cunning ; but trapping has been there so long carried 
on, that inheritance may possibly have come into play. 
J have received several accounts that when telegraphs 
are first set up in any district, many birds kill them- 
selves by flying against the wires, but that in the 
course of a very few years they learn to avoid this 
danger, by seeing, as it would appear, their comrades 
killed.3^ 

If we look to successive generations, or to the race, 
there is no doubt that birds and other animals gradu- 
ally both acquire and lose caution in relation to man 
or other enemies and this caution is certainly in 
chief part an inherited habit or instinct, but in part 
the result of individual experience. A good observer, 
Leroy,^^ states, that in districts where foxes are much 
bunted, the young, on first leaving their burrows, are 
incontestably much more wary than the old ones in 
districts where they are not much disturbed. 

Our domestic dogs are descended from wolves and 
jackals,^® and though they may not have gained in 
cunning, and may have lost in wariness and suspicion, 
yet they have progressed in certain moral qualities, 
such as in aflection, trust- worthiness, temper, and pro- 
bably in general intelligence. The common rat has 
conquered and beaten several other species throughout

Enrope, in parts of North America, New Zealand, and 
recently in Formosa, as well as on the mainland of 
China. Mr. Swinhoe,^* who describes these two latter 
cases, attributes the victory of the common rat over 
the large Mus coninga to its superior cunning ; and 
this latter quality may probably be attributed to the 
habitual exercise of all its faculties in avoiding extir- 
pation by man, as well as to nearly all the less cunning 
or weak-minded rats having been continuously de- 
stroyed by’ him. It is, however, possible that the 
success of the common rat may be due to its having 
possessed greater cunning than its fellow-species, 
before it became associated with man. To maintain, 
independently of any direct evidence, that no animal 
during the course of ages has progressed in intellect 
or other mental faculties, is to beg the question of the 
evolution of species. We have seen that, according to 
Lartet, existing mammals belonging to several orders 
have larger brains than their ancient tertiary proto- 
types. 

It has often been said that no animal uses any tool ; 
but the chimpanzee in a state of nature cracks a 
native fruit, somewhat like a walnut, with a stone.®’ 
Kengger easily taught an American monkey thus to 
break open hard palm-nuts ; and afterwards of its own 
accord, it used stones to open other kinds of nuts, as 
well as boxes. It thus also removed the soft rind of 
fruit that had a disagreeable flavour. Another monkey 
was taught to open the lid of a large box with a stick,

and afterwards it used the stick as a lever to move 
heavy bodies ; and I have myself seen a young orang 
put a stick into a crevice, slip his hand to the other 
end, and use it in the proper manner as a lever. The 
tamed elephants in India are well known to break off 
branches of trees and use them to drive away the flies ; 
and this same act has been observed in an elephant in 
a state of nature.^® I have seen a young orang, when 
she thought she was going to be whipped, cover and 
protect herself with a blanket or straw. In these 
several cases stones and sticks were employed as 
implements ; but they are likewise used as weapons. 
Brehm^° states, on the authority of the well-known 
traveller Schimper, that in Abyssinia when the 
baboons belonging to one species (G. gelada) descend 
in troops from the mountains to plunder the fields, 
they sometimes encounter troops of another species 
((7. hamadryas), and then a fight ensues. The Geladas 
roll down great stones, which the Hamadryas try to 
avoid, and then both species, making a great uproar, 
rush furiously against each other. Brehm, when, 
accompanying the Duke of Coburg-Gotha, aided in 
an attack with fire-arms on a troop of baboons 
in the pass of Mensa in Abyssinia. The baboons in 
return roiled so many stones down the mountain, some 
as large as a man’s head, that the attackers had to 
beat a hasty retreat ; and the pass was actually closed 
for a time against the caravan. It deserves notice 
that these baboons thus acted in concert. Mr. 
Wallace on three occasions saw female orangs, ac-

companied by tbeir young, “ breaking off branches and 
“ the great spiny fruit of the Durian tree, with every 
“ appearance of rage ; causing such a shower of 
“ missiles as effectually kept us from approaching too 
“ near the tree.” As I have repeatedly seen, a 
chimpanzee will throw any object at hand at a person 
who offends him ; and the before-mentioned baboon at 
the Cape of Good Hope prepared mud for the purpose. 

In the Zoological Gardens, a monkey, which had 
weak teeth, used to break open nuts with a stone ; 
and I was assured by the keepers that after using the 
stone, he hid it in the straw, and would not let any 
other monkey touch it. Here, then, we have the idea 
of property; but this idea is common to every dog 
with a bone, and to most or all birds with their nests. 

The Duke of Argyll remarks, that the fashioning 
of an implement for a special purpose is absolutely 
peculiar to man ; and he considers that this forms an 
immeasurable gulf between him and the brutes. This 
is no doubt a very important distinction ; but there 
appears to me much truth in Sir J. Lubbock’s sugges- 
tion,^® that when primeval man first used fiint- 
stones for any purpose, he would have accidentally 
splintered them, and would then have used the sharp 
fragments. From this step it would be a small one to 
break the flints on purpose, and not a very wide step 
to fashion them rudely. This latter advance, however; 
may have taken long ages, if we may judge by the 
immense interval of time which elapsed before the men 
of the neolithic period took to grinding and polishing 
their stone tools. In breaking the flints, as Sir J.

Lubbock likewise remarks, sparks would have been 
emitted, and in grinding them heat would have been 
evolved : thus the two usual methods of “ obtaining 
fire may have originated.” The nature of fire would 
have been known in the many volcanic regions where 
lava occasionally flows through forests. The anthropo- 
morphous apes, guided probably by instinct, build for 
themselves temporary platforms; but as many in- 
stincts are largely controlled by reason, the simpler 
ones, such as this of building a platform, might readily 
pass into a voluntary and conscious act. The orang is 
known to cover itself at night with the leaves of the 
Pandanus ; and Brehm states that one of his baboons 
used to protect itself from the heat of the sun by 
throwing a straw-mat over its head. In these several 
habits, we probably see the first steps towards some of 
the simpler arts, such as rude architecture and dress, 
as they arose amongst the early progenitors of man. 

Abstraction^ General Gonceftions, Self-consciousness^ 
Mental Individuality, — It would be very difficult for 
any one with even much more knowledge than I 
possess, to determine how far animals exhibit any 
traces of these high mental powers. This difficulty 
arises from the impossibility of judging what passes 
through the mind of an animal ; and again, the fact 
that writers differ to a great extent in the meaning 
which they attribute to the above terms, causes a 
further difficulty. If one may judge from various 
articles which have been published lately, the greatest 
stress seems to be laid on the supposed entire absence 
in animals of the power of abstraction, or of forming 
general concepts. But when a dog sees another dog 
at a distance, it is often clear that he perceives that it 


Chap. III.

127 


is a dog in the abstract ; for when he gets nearer his 
whole manner suddenly changes, if the other dog be a 
friend. A recent writer remarks, that in all such 
cases it is a pure assumption to assert that the mental 
act is not essentially of the same nature in the animal 
as in man. If either refers what he perceives with his 
senses to a mental concept, then so do both.^^ When 
I say to my terrier, in an eager voice (and I have 
made the trial many times), “ Hi, hi, where is it ? ” 
she at once takes it as a sign that something is to be 
hunted, and generally first looks quickly all around, 
and then rushes into the nearest thicket, to scent for 
any game, but finding nothing, she looks up into any 
neighbouring tree for a squirrel. Now do not these 
actions clearly shew that she had in her mind a general 
idea or concept that some animal is to be discovered and 
hunted ? 

It may be freely admitted that no animal is self- 
conscious, if by this term it is implied, that he reflects 
on such points, as whence he comes or whither he will 
go, or what is life and death, and so forth. But how 
can we feel sure that an old dog with an excellent 
memory and some power of imagination, as shewn by 
his dreams, never reflects on his past pleasures or 
pains in the chase ? And this would be a form of 
self-consciousness. On the other hand, as Buchner 
has remarked, how little can the hard- worked wife of a 
degraded Australian savage, who uses very few abstract 
words, and cannot count above four, exert her self- 
consciousness, or reflect on the nature of her own

existence. It is generally admitted, that the higher 
animals possess memory, attention, association, and 
even some imagination and reason. If these powers, 
which differ much in different animals, are capable of 
improvement, there seems no great improbability in 
more complex faculties, such as the higher forms of 
abstraction, and self-consciousness, &c., having been 
evolved through the development and combination of 
the simpler ones. It has been urged against the views 
here maintained that it is impossible to say at what point 
in the ascending scale animals become capable of abstrac- 
tion, &c. ; but who can say at what age this occurs in our 
young children? We see at least that such powers are 
developed in children by imperceptible degrees. 

That animals retain their mental individuality is 
unquestionable. When my voice awakened a train of 
old associations in the mind of the before-mentioned 
dog, he must have retained his mental individuality, 
although every atom of his brain had probably under- 
gone change more than once during the interval of 
five years. This dog might have brought forward the 
argument lately advanced to crush all evolutionists, 
and said, “I abide amid all mental moods and all 
“ material changes. . . . The teaching that atoms leave 
‘‘ their impressions as legacies to other atoms falling 
“ into the places they have vacated is contradictory of 
“ the utterance of consciousness, and is therefore false ; 
“ but it is the teaching necessitated by evolutionism, 
“ consequently the hypothesis is a false one.” 

Language . — This faculty has justly been considered 
as one of the chief distinctions between man and the 
lower animals. But man, as a highly competent

judge, Archbishop Whately remarks, “ is not the 
“ only animal that can make use of language to 
“ express what is passing in his mind, and can under- 
“ stand, more or less, what is so expressed by 
“ another.” In Paraguay the Cehus azarse when 
excited utters at least six distinct sounds, which 
excite in other monkeys similar emotions.'^® The 
movements of the features and gestures of monkeys 
are understood by us, and they partly understand 
ours, as Kengger and others declare. It is a more 
remarkable fact that the dog, since being domesticated, 
has learnt to bark^® in at least four or five distinct 
tones. Although barking is a new art, no doubt the 
wild parent-species of the dog expressed their feelings 
by cries of various kinds. With the domesticated dog 
we have the bark of eagerness, as in the chase ; that 
of anger, as well as growling ; the yelp or howl of 
despair, as when shut up ; the baying at night ; the 
bark of joy, as when starting on a walk with his 
master ; and the very distinct one of demand or 
supplication, as when wishing for a door or window 
to be opened. According to Houzeau, who paid 
particular attention to the subject, the domestic 
fowl utters at least a dozen significant sounds.®® 

The habitual use of articulate language is, however, 
peculiar to man ; but he uses, in common with the lower 
animals, inarticulate cries to express his meaning, 
aided by gestures and the movements of the muscles of 
the face.®^ This especially holds good with the more

simple and vivid feelings, whicli are but little con- 
nected with our higher intelligence. Our cries of pain, 
fear, surprise, anger, together with the their appro- 
priate actions, and the murmur of a mother to her 
' beloved child, are more expressive than any words. 
That which distinguishes man from the lower animals 
is not the understanding of articulate sounds, for, as 
every one knows, dogs understand many words and 
sentences. In this respect they are at the same stage 
of development as infants, between the ages of ten and 
twelve months, who understand many words and short 
sentences, but cannot yet utter a single word. It is 
not the mere articulation which is our distinguishing 
character, for parrots and other birds possess this 
power. Nor is it the mere capacity of connecting 
definite sounds with definite ideas; for it is certain 
that some parrots, which have been taught to speak, 
connect unerringly words with things, and persons 
with events.®^ The lower animals differ from man

I know to be a careful observer, 
assures me that an African 
parrot, long kept in his father’s 
house, invariably called certain 
persons of the household, as 
well as visitors, by their names. 
He said “good morning” to 
every one at breakfast, and 
“ go^ night ” to each as they 
left the room at night, and 
never reversed these salutations. 


To Sir B. J. Sulivan’s father, he 
used to add to the “ good morn- 
ing” a short sentence, which 
was never once repeated after 
his father’s death. He scolded 
violently a strange dog which 
came into the room through the 
open window; and he scolded 
another parrot (saying “ you 
naughty polly ”) which had got 
out of its cage, and was eating 
apples on the kitchen table.

solely in his almost infinitely larger power of associa- 
ting together the most diversified sounds and ideas ; 
and this obviously depends on the high development 
of his mental powers. 

As Horne Tooke, one of the founders of the noble 
science of philology, observes, language is an art, like 
brewing or baking ; but writing would have been a 
better simile. It certainly is not a true instinct, for 
every language has to be learnt. It differs, however, 
widely from all ordinary arts, for man has an instinc- 
tive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our 
young children ; whilst no child has an instinctive 
tendency to brew, bake, or write. Moreover, no 
philologist now supposes that any language has been 
deliberately invented ; it has been slowly and uncon- 
sciously developed by many steps.®® The sounds 
uttered by birds offer in several respects the nearest 
analogy to language, for all the members of the same 
species utter the same instinctive cries expressive of 
their emotions; and all the kinds which sing, exert 
their power instinctively ; but the actual song, and even 
the call-notes, are learnt from their parents or foster^ 
parents. These sounds, as Daines Barrington®^ has 
proved, ‘‘ are no more innate than language is in man.”

Part I. 


The first attempts to sing may be compared to the 
“ imperfect endeavour in a child to babble.” The 
young males continue practising, or as the bird- 
catchers say, “ recording,” for ten or eleven months. 
Their first essays show hardly a rudiment of the future 
song ; but as they grow older we can perceive what 
they are aiming at ; and at last they are said “ to sing 
“ their song round.” Nestlings which have learnt the 
song of a distinct species, as with the canary-birds 
educated in the Tyrol, teach and transmit their new 
song to their offspring. The slight natural "differences 
of song in the same species inhabiting different 
districts may be appositely compared, as Barrington 
remarks, “ to provincial dialects ; ” and the songs of 
allied, though distinct species may be compared with 
the languages of distinct races of man. I have given 
the foregoing details to shew that an instinctive 
tendency to acquire an art is not peculiar to man. 

With respect to the origin of articulate language, 
after having read on the one side the highly interest- 
ing works of Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, the Bev. F. 
Farrar, and Prof. Schleicher,®® and the celebrated 
lectures of Prof. Max Muller on the other side, I can- 
not doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation 
and modification of various natural sounds, the voices 
of other animals, and man’s own instinctive cries, aided 
by signs and gestures. When we treat of sexual

selection we shall see that primeval man, or rather 
some early progenitor of man, probably first used his 
voice in producing true musical cadences, that is in 
singing, as do some of the gibbon-apes at the present 
day; and we may conclude from a widely-spread 
analogy, that this power would have been especially 
exerted during the courtship of the sexes, — would have 
expressed various emotions, such as love, jealousy, 
triumph, — and would have served as a challenge to 
rivals. It is, therefore, probable that the imitation of 
musical cries by articulate sounds may have given 
rise to words expressive of various complex emotions. 
The strong tendency in our nearest allies, the monkeys, 
in microcephalous idiots,®® and in the barbarous races of 
mankind, to imitate whatever they hear deserves notice, 
as bearing on the subject of imitation. Since monkeys 
certainly understand much that is said to them by 
man, and when wild, utter signal-cries of danger to 
their fellows ; and since fowls give distinct warnings 
for danger on the ground, or in the sky from hawks 
(both, as well as a third cry, intelligible to dogs),®® may 
not some unusually wise ape-like animal have imitated 
the growl of a beast of prey, and thus told his fellow- 
monkeys the nature of the expected danger ? This would 
have been a first step in the formation of a language. 

As the voice was used more and more, the vocal 
organs would have been strengthened and perfected 
through the principle of the inherited efiects of use ;

and this would have reacted on the power of speech. 
But the relation between the continued use of language 
and the development of the brain, has no doubt been 
to more important. The mental powers in some 
early progenitor of man must have been more highly 
developed than in any existing ape, before even the 
most imperfect form of speech could have come into 
use ; but we may confidently believe that the continued 
use and advancement of this power would have reacted 
on the mind itself, by enabling and encouraging 
it to carry on long trains of thought. A complex 
train of thought can no more he carried on with- 
out the aid of words, whether spoken or silent, 
than a long calculation without the use of figures or 
algebra. It appears, also, that even an ordinary train 
of thought almost requires, or is greatly facilitated by 
some form of language, for the dumb, deaf, and blind 
girl, Laura Bridgman, was observed to use her fingers 
whilst dreaming.*^® Nevertheless, a long succession of 
vivid and connected ideas may pass through the mind 
without the aid of any form of language, as we may 
infer from the movements of dogs during their dreams. 
We have, also, seen that animals are able to reason to 
a certain extent, manifestly without the aid of language. 
The intimate connection between the brain, as it is 
now developed in us, and the faculty of speech, is well 
shewn by those curious cases of brain-disease in which 
speech is specially affected, as when the power to 
remember substantives is lost, whilst other words can 
be correctly used, or where substantives of a certain 
class, or all except the initial letters of substantives

and proper names are forgotten. There is no more 
improbability in the continued use of the mental and 
vocal organs leading to inherited changes in their 
structure and functions, than in the case of hand- 
writing, which depends partly on the form of the hand 
and partly on the disposition of the mind ; and hand- 
writing is certainly inherited.®^ 

Several writers, more especially Prof. Max Muller,®^ 
have lately insisted that the use of language implies 
the power of forming general concepts ; and that as no 
animals are supposed to possess this power, an 
impassable barrier is formed between them and man.®®

to shew that they have this power, at least in a rude 
and incipient degree. As far as concerns infants of 
from ten to eleven months old, and deaf-mutes, it 
seems to me incredible, that they should be able to 
connect certain sounds with certain general ideas as 
quickly as they do, unless such ideas were already 
formed in their minds. The same remark may be 
extended to the more intelligent animals ; as Mr. 
Leslie Stephen observes,®^ “ A dog frames a general 
“concept of cats or sheep, and knows the correspond - 
“ ing words as well as a philosopher. And the capacity 
“ to understand is as good a proof of vocal intelligence, 
“ though in an inferior degree, as the capacity to speak.” 
Why the organs now used for speech should have 
been originally perfected for this purpose, rather than 
any other organs, it is not difficult to see. Ants have 
considerable powers of intercommunication by means 
of their antennae, as shewn by Huber, who devotes 
a whole chapter to their language. We might have 
used our fingers as efficient instruments, for a person 
with practice can report to a deaf man every word of a 
speech rapidly delivered at a public meeting ; but the 
loss of our hands, whilst thus employed, would have been 
a serious inconvenience. As all the higher mammals 
possess vocal organs, constructed on the same general 
plan as ours, and used as a means of communication, it 
was obviously probable that these same organs would 
be still further developed if the power of communica- 
tion had to be improved ; and this has been effected by 
the aid of adjoining and well adapted parts, namely the 
tongue and lips.®® The fact of the higher apes not

using their vocal organs for speech, no doubt depends 
on their intelligence not having been sufficiently 
advanced. The possession by them of organs, which 
with long-continued practice might have been used for 
speech, although not thus used, is paralleled by the 
case of many birds which possess organs fitted for 
singing, though they never sing. Thus, the nightin- 
gale and crow have vocal organs similarly constructed, 
these being used by the former for diversified song, and 
by the latter only for croaking.®® If it be asked why 
apes have not had their intellects developed to the 
same degree as that of man, general causes only can 
be assigned in answer, and it is unreasonable to expect 
anything more definite, considering our ignorance 
with respect to the successive stages of development 
through which each creature has passed. 

The formation of different languages and of distinct 
species, and the proofs that both have been developed 
through a gradual process, are curiously parallel.®^ 
S But we can trace the formation of many words further 
back than that of species, for we can perceive how they 
actually arose from the imitation of various sounds. 
We find in distinct languages striking homologies 
due to community of descent, and analogies due to 
a similar process of formation. The manner in which

certain letters or sounds change when others change is 
very like correlated growth. We have in both cases 
the reduplication of parts, the effects of long-continned 
use, and so forth. The frequent presence of rudi- 
ments, both in languages and in species, is still more 
remarkable. The letter m in the word am, means 1 ; 
so that in the expression I am, a superfluous and use- 
less rudiment has been retained. In the spelling also 
of words, letters often remain as the rudiments of 
ancient forms of pronunciation. Languages, like 
organic beings, can be classed in groups under groups ; 
and they can be classed either naturally according to 
descent, or artificially by other characters. Dominant 
languages and dialects spread widely, and lead to the 
gradual extinction of other tongues. A language, like 
a species, when once extinct, never, as Sir 0. Lyell 
remarks, reappears. The same language never has 
two birth-places. Distinct languages may be crossed 
or blended together.®® We see variability in every 
tongue, and new words are continually cropping up ; 
but as there is a limit to the powers of the memory, 
single words, like whole languages, gradually become 
extinct. As Max Muller has well remarked : — ‘‘ A 
“ struggle for life is constantly going on amongst the 
“ words and grammatical forms in each language. The 
“better, the shorter, the easier forms are constantly 
“ gaining the upper hand, and they owe their success to 
“ their own inherent virtue.” To these more important 
causes of the survival of certain words, mere novelty 
and fashion may be added ; for there is in the mind of

man a strong love for slight changes in all things. The 
survival or preservation of certain favoured words 
in the struggle for existence is natural selection. 

The perfectly regular and wonderfully complex con- 
struction of the languages of many barbarous nations 
has often been advanced as a proof, either of the divine 
origin of these languages, or of the high art and 
former civilisation of their founders. Thus F. von 
Schlegel writes: “In those languages which appear 
“ to be at the lowest grade of intellectual culture, 
“ we frequently observe a very high and elaborate 
“ degree of art in their grammatical structure. This 
“ is especially the case with the Basque and the 
“ Lapponian, and many of the American languages.” 
But it is assuredly an error to speak of any language 
as an art, in the sense of its having been elaborately 
and methodically formed. Philologists now admit that 
conjugations, declensions, &c., originally existed as 
distinct words, since joined together ; and as such 
words express the most obvious relations between 
objects and persons, it is not surprising that they 
should have been used by the men of most races 
during the earliest ages. With respect to perfection, 
the following illustration will best shew how easily we 
may err : a Crinoid sometimes consists of no less than 
150,000 pieces of shell,’^ all arranged with perfect 
symmetry in radiating lines ; but a naturalist does not 
consider an animal of this kind as more perfect than a 
bilateral one with comparatively few parts, and with 
none of these parts alike, excepting on the opposite

sides of the body. He justly considers the differentia- 
tion and specialisation of organs as the test of per- 
fection. So with languages : the most symmetrical and 
complex ought not to he ranked above irregular, abbre- 
viated, and bastardised languages, which have borrowed 
expressive words and useful forms of construction from 
various conquering, conquered, or immigrant races. 

From these few and imperfect remarks I conclude 
that the extremely complex and regular construction 
of many barbarous languages, is no proof that they owe 
their origin to a special act of creation.’^ Nor, as we 
have seen, does the faculty of articulate speech in 
itself offer any insuperable objection to the belief that 
man has been developed from some lower form. 

Sense of Beauty . — This sense has been declared to be 
peculiar to man. I refer here only to the pleasure 
given by certain colours, forms, and sounds, and which 
may fairly be called a sense of the beautiful; with 
cultivated men such sensations are, however, intimately 
associated with complex ideas and trains of thought. 
When we behold a male bird elaborately displaying his 
graceful plumes or splendid colours before the female, 
whilst other birds, not thus decorated, make no such 
display, it is impossible to doubt that she admires the 
beauty of her male partner. As women everywhere 
deck themselves with these plumes, the beauty of such 
ornaments cannot be disputed. As we shall see later, 
the nests of humming-birds, and the playing passages 
of bower-birds are tastefully ornamented with gaily- 
coloured objects ; and this shews that they must receive 
some kind of pleasure from the sight of such things. 

See some good remarks on by Sir J. Lubbock, ‘ Origin of 
the simplification of laoguages, Civilisation, 1870, p. 278. 


Chap. III. 


MENTAL POWERS. 


141 


With the great majority of animals, however, the taste 
for the beautiful is confined, as far as we can judge, to 
the attractions of the opposite sex. The sweet strains 
poured forth by many male birds during the season of 
love, are certainly admired by the females, of which 
fact evidence will hereafter be given. If female birds 
had been incapable of appreciating the beautiful 
colours, the ornaments, and voices of their male 
partners, all the labour and anxiety exhibited by the 
latter in displaying their charms before the females 
would have been thrown away ; and this it is impos- 
sible to admit. Why certain bright colours should 
excite pleasure cannot, I presume, be explained, any 
more than why certain flavours and scents are agreeable ; 
but habit has something to do with the result, for that 
which is at first unpleasant to our senses, ultimately 
becomes pleasant, and habits are inherited. With 
respect to sounds, Helmholtz has explained to a certain 
extent on physiological principles, why harmonies and 
certain cadences are agreeable. But besides this, sounds 
frequently recurring at irregular intervals are highly 
disagreeable, as every one will admit who has listened 
at night to the irregular flapping of a rope on board 
ship. The same principle seems to come into play 
•with vision, as the eye prefers symmetry or figures 
with some regular recurrence. Patterns of this kind 
are employed by even the lowest savages as ornaments ; 
and they have been developed through sexual selection 
for the adornment of some male animals. Whether 
we can or not give any reason for the pleasure thus 
derived from vision and hearing, yet man and many of 
the lower animals are alike pleased by the same colours, 
graceful shading and forms, and the same sounds. 


142 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Pabt I. 


The taste for the beautiful, at least as far as female 
beauty is concerned, is not of a special nature in the 
human mind; for it differs widely in the different 
races of man, and is not quite the same even in the 
different nations of the same race. Judging from the 
hideous ornaments, and the equally hideous music 
admired by most savages, it might be urged that their 
aesthetic faculty was not so highly developed as in 
certain animals, for instance, as in birds. Obviously 
no animal would be capable of admiring such scenes as 
the heavens at night, a beautiful landscape, or refined 
music ; but such high tastes are acquired through 
culture, and depend on complex associations ; they are 
not enjoyed by barbarians or by uneducated persons. 

Many of the faculties, which have been of inestima- 
ble service to man for his progressive advancement, 
such as the powers of the imagination, wonder, 
curiosity, an undefined sense of beauty, a tendency 
to imitation, and the love of excitement or novelty, 
could hardly fail to lead to capricious changes of 
customs and fashions. I have alluded to this point, 
because a recent writer’^ has oddly fixed on Caprice 
as one of the most remarkable and typical difierences 
“ between savages and brutes.” But not only can we 
partially understand how it is that man is from various' 
conflicting influences rendered capricious, but that the 
lower animals are, as we shall hereafter see, likewise 
capricious in their affections, aversions, and sense of 
beauty. There is also reason to suspect that they love 
novelty, for its own sake. 

Belief in God — Religion . — There is no evidence that 
‘ The Spectator,’ Dec. 4th, 1869, p. 1430, 


Chap. III. 


MENTAL TOWERS. 


143 


man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling 
belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God. On tbe 
contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from 
hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided 
with savages, that numerous races have existed, and 
still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and 
who have no words in their languages to express such 
an idea.’^ The question is of course wholly distinct 
from that higher one, whether there exists a Creator 
and Kuler of the universe ; and this has been answered 
in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that 
have ever existed. 

If, however, we include under the term religion ” 
the belief in unseen or spiritual agencies, the case is 
wholly different ; for this belief seems to be universal 
with the less civilised races. Nor is it difficult to 
comprehend how it arose. As soon as the important 
faculties of the imagination, wonder, and curiosity, 
together with some power of reasoning, had become 
partially developed, man would naturally crave to 
understand what was passing around him, and would 
have vaguely speculated on his own existence. As 
Mr. M’Lennan has remarked, “ Some explanation of 
‘‘ the phenomena of life, a man must feign for himself, 
“ and to judge from the universality of it, the simplest 
“ hypothesis, and the first to occur to men, seems to 
“ have been that natural phenomena are ascribable to

“ tlie presence in animals, plants, and things, and in 
“ the forces of nature, of such spirits prompting to 
“ action as men are conscious they themselves possess.’ 
It is also probable, as Mr. Tylor has shewn, that 
dreams may have first given rise to the notion of 
spirits ; for savages do not readily distinguish between 
subjective and objective impressions. When a savage 
dreams, the figures which appear before him are 
believed to have come from a distance, and to stand 
over him ; or “ the soul of the dreamer goes out on its 
“ travels, and comes home with a remembrance of 
“ what it has seen.” But until the faculties of 


imagination, curiosity, reason, &c., had been fairly 
well developed in the mind of man, his dreams would 
not have led him to believe in spirits, any more than 
in the case of a dog. 

The tendency in savages to imagine that natural 


objects and agencies are 
living essences, is perhaps

Mankind,’ 1865, p. 6. See also

Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his in- 
genious essay in the ‘ Fort- 
nightly Review ’ (May 1st, 1870, 
p. 535), accounts for the earliest 
forms of religious belief through- 
out the world, by man being 
led through dreams, shadows, 
and other causes, to look at 
himself as a double essence, 
corporeal and spiritual. As the 
spiritual being is supposed to 
exist after death and to be 
powerful, it is propitiated by 
various gifts and ceremonies, 


animated by spiritual or 
illustrated by a little fact 

and its aid invoked. He then 
further shews that names or 
nicknames given from some 
animal or other object, to the 
early progenitors or founders of 
a tribe, are supposed after a 
long interval to represent the 
real progenitor of the tribe ; and 
such animal or object is then 
naturally believed still to exist 
as a spirit, is held sacred, and 
worshipped as a god. Never- 
theless I cannot but suspect 
that there is a still earlier and 
ruder stage, when anything 
which manifests power or move- 
ment is thought to be endowed 
with some form of life, and with 
mental faculties analogous to our 
owu.

which I once noticed : my dog, a full-grown and very 
sensible animal, was lying on the lawn during a hot 
and still day ; but at a little distance a slight breeze 
occasionally moved an open parasol, which would have 
been wholly disregarded by the dog, had any one stood 
near it. As it was, every time that the parasol slightly 
moved, the dog growled fiercely and barked. He 
must, I think, have reasoned to himself in a rapid 
and unconscious manner, that movement without any 
apparent cause indicated the presence of some strange 
living agent, and that no stranger had a right to be on 
his territory. 

The belief in spiritual agencies would easily pass 
into the belief in the existence of one or more gods. 
For savages would naturally attribute to spirits the 
same passions, the same love of vengeance or simplest 
form of justice, and the same affections which they 
themselves feel. The Fuegians appear to be in this 
respect in an intermediate condition, for when the 
surgeon on board the Beagle ” shot some young 
ducklings as specimens, York Minster declared in the 
most solemn manner, “ Oh, Mr. Bynoe, much rain, 
“ much snow, blow much ; ” and this was evidently 
a retributive punishment for wasting human food. So 
again he related how, when his brother killed a “ wild 
“ man,” storms long raged, much rain and snow fell. 
Yet we could never discover that the Fuegians believed 
in what we should call a Hod, or practised any religious 
rites; and Jemmy Button, with justifiable pride, 
stoutly maintained that there was no devil in his land. 
This latter assertion is the more remarkable, as with 
savages the belief in bad spirits is far more common 
than that in good ones.

The feeling of religious devotion is a highly complex 
one, consisting of love, complete submission to an 
exalted and mysterious superior, a strong sense of 
dependence,’’ fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for the 
future, and perhaps other elements. No being could 
experience so complex an emotion until advanced in 
his intellectual and moral faculties to at least a 
moderately high level. Nevertheless, we see some 
distant approach to this state of mind in the deep love 
of a dog for his master, associated with complete sub- 
mission, some fear, and perhaps other feelings. The 
behaviour of a dog when returning to his master after 
an absence, and, as I may add, of a monkey to his 
beloved keeper, is widely different from that towards 
their fellows. In the latter case the transports of joy 
appear to be somewhat less, and the sense of equality 
is shewn in every action. Professor Braubach goes so 
far as to maintain that a dog looks on his master as on 
a god.’® 

The same high mental faculties which first led man 
to believe in unseen spiritual agencies, then in 
fetishism, polytheism, and ultimately in monotheism, 
would infallibly lead him, as long as his reasoning 
powers remained poorly developed, to various strange 
superstitions and customs. Many of these are terrible 
to think of — such as the sacrifice of human beings to a 
blood-loving god ; the trial of innocent persons by the 
ordeal of poison or fire ; witchcraft, &c. — yet it is well

shew us what an infinite debt of gratitude we owe to 
the improvement of our reason, to science, and to our

observed, it is not too much fco say that the horrible 
‘‘ dread of unknown evil hangs like a thick cloud over

I FULLY subscribe to tbe judgment of those writers' 
who maintain that of all the differences between man 
and the lower animals, the moral sense or conscience is 
by far the most important. This sense, as Mackintosh^ 
remarks, “has a rightful supremacy over every other 
“ principle of human action ; ” it is summed up in that 
short but imperious word oughty so full of high 
significance. It is the most noble of all the attributes 
of man, leading him without a moment’s hesitation to 
risk his life for that of a fellow-creature ; or after due 
deliberation, impelled simply by the deep feeling of 
right or duty, to sacrifice it in some great cause. 
Immanuel Kant exclaims, “ Duty ! Wondrous thought, 
“ that workest neither by fond insinuation, flattery, 
“ nor by any threat, but merely by holding up thy

This great question has been discussed by many 
writers* of consummate ability; and my sole excuse 
for touching on it, is the impossibility of here passing 
it over; and because, as far as I know, no one has 
approached it exclusively from the side of natural 
history. The investigation possesses, also, some in- 
dependent interest, as an attempt to see how far the 
study of the lower animals throws light on one of the 
highest psychical faculties of man. 

The following proposition seems to me in a high 
degree probable — namely, that any animal whatever, 
endowed with well-marked social instincts,® the pa-

tal and Moral Science,’ 1868, p.

these, Mr. Bain’s own name,

® Sir B. Brodie, after observing 
that man is a social animal 
( ‘ Psychological Enquiries,’ 1854, 
p. 192), asks the pregnant ques- 
tion, “ought not this to settle 
“ the disputed question as to 
*• the existence of a moral 
“sense?” Similar ideas have 
probably occurred to many per- 
sons, as they did long ago to 


Marcus Aurelius. Mr. J. S. Mill 
speaks, in his celebrated work, 
* Utilitarianism,’ (1864, pp. 45, 
46), of the social feelings as a 
“powerful natural sentiment,” 
and as “the natural basis of 
“sentiment for utilitarian mo- 
“ rality.” Again he says, “ Like 
“the other acquired capacities 
“above referred to, the moral 
“faculty, if not a part of our 
“ nature, is a natural out-growth 
“from it; capable, like them, 
“in a certain small degree of 
“springing up spontaneously.” 
But in opposition to all this, he 
also remarks, “ if, as is my own 
“belief, the moral feelings are 
“ not innate, but acquired, they 
“are not for that reason less 
“ natural.” It is with hesitation 
that I venture to differ at all 
from so profound a thinker, but

rental and filial alfections being here included, would 
inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon 
as its intellectual powers had become as well, or nearly 
as well developed, as in man. For, firstly, the social 
instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society 
of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy 
with them, and to perform various services for them. 
The services may be of a definite and evidently in- 
stinctive nature; or there may be only a wish and 
readiness, as with most of the higher social animals, 
to aid their fellows in certain general ways. But 
these feelings and services are by no means extended 
to all the individuals of the same species, only to those 
of the same association. Secondly, as soon as the 
mental faculties had become highly developed, images 
of all past actions and motives would be incessantly 
passing through the brain of each individual ; and 
that feeling of dissatisfaction, or even misery, which 
invariably results, as we shall hereafter see, from any 
unsatisfied instinct, would arise, as often as it was 
perceived that the enduring and always present social 
instinct had yielded to some other instinct, at the time 
stronger, but neither enduring in its nature, nor 
leaving behind it a very vivid impression. It is clear 
that many instinctive desires, such as that of hunger. 


the social feelings are instinctive 
or innate in the lower animals ; 
and why should they not be so 
in man? Mr. Bain (see, for 
instance, ‘The Emotions and 
the Will,’ 1865, p. 481) and 
others believe that the moral 
sense is acquired by each in- 
dividual during his lifetime. 


On the general theory of evolu- 
tion this is at least extremely 
improbable. The ignoring of 
all transmitted mental qualities 
will, as it seems to me, be here- 
after judged as a most serious 
blemish in the works of Mr. 
Mill

are in their nature of short duration ; and after being 
satisfied, are not readily or vividly recalled. Thirdly, 
after the power of language had been acquired, and 
the wishes of the community could be expressed, the 
common opinion how each member ought to act for 
the public good, would naturally become in a para- 
mount degree the guide to action. But it should be 
borne in mind that however great weight we may 
attribute to public opinion, our regard for the appro- 
bation and disapprobation of our fellows depends on 
sympathy, which, as we shall see, forms an essential 
part of the social instinct, and is indeed its foundation- 
stone. Lastly, habit in the individual would ultimately 
play a very important part in guiding the conduct of 
each member ; for the social instinct, together with sym- 
pathy, is, like any other instinct, greatly strengthened 
by habit, and so consequently would be obedience to 
the wishes and judgment of the community. These 
several subordinate propositions must now be discussed, 
and some of them at considerable length. 

It may be well first to premise that I do not wish to 
maintain that any strictly social animal, if its in- 
tellectual faculties were to become as active and as 
highly developed as in man, would acquire exactly the 
same moral sense as ours. In the same manner as 
various animals have some sense of beauty, though 
they admire widely different objects, so they might 
have a sense of right and wrong, though led by it 
to follow widely different lines of conduct. If, for 
instance, to take an extreme case, men were reared 
under precisely the same conditions as hive-bees, there 
can hardly be a doubt that our unmarried females 
would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to

kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill 
their fertile daughters; and no one would think of 
interfering.® Nevertheless, the bee, or any other 
social animal, would gain in our supposed case, as it 
appears to me, some feeling of right or wrong, or a 
conscience. For each individual would have an inward 
sense of possessing certain stronger or more enduring 
instincts, and others less strong or enduring; so that 
there would often he a struggle as to which impulse 
should be followed ; and satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or 
even misery would be felt, as past impressions were 
compared during their incessant passage through the 
mind. In this case an inward monitor would tell the 
animal that it would have been better to have followed 
the one impulse rather than the other. The one 
course ought to have been followed, and the other 
ought not ; the one would have been right and the 
other wrong ; but to these terms I shall recur. 


• Mr. H. Sidgwick remarks, 
in an able discussion on this 
subject (the ‘Academy,* June 
15th, 1872, p. 231), “ a superior 
“ bee, we may feel sure, would 
“ aspire to a milder solution 
“of the population question.” 
Judging, however, from the 
habits of many or most savages, 
man solves the problem by fe- 
male infanticide, polyandry and 
promiscuous intercourse ; there- 
fore it may well be doubted 
whether it would be by a milder 
method. Miss Cobbe, in com- 
menting (‘Darwinism in Morals,’ 
‘ Theological Keview,’ April, 
1872, p. 188-191) on the same 
illustration, says, the principles 
of social duty would be thus 
reversed; and by this, I pre- 


sume, she means that the fulfil- 
ment of a social duty would tend 
to the injury of individuals ; 
but she oveilooks the fact, 
which she would doubtless ad- 
mit, that the instincts of the 
bee have been acquired for the 
good of the community. She 
goes so far as to say that if the 
theory of ethics advocated in 
this chapter were ever generally 
accepted, “ I cannot but believe 
“ that in the hour of their 
“ triumph would be sounded 
“ the knell of the virtue of 
mankind 1 ” It is to be hoped 
that the behef in the perma- 
nence of virtue on this earth is 
not held by many persons on so 
weak a tenure.

Sociability , — Animals of many kinds are social; we 
find even distinct species living together ; for example, 
some American monkeys ; and united flocks of rooks, 
jackdaws, and starlings. Man shews the same feeling 
in his strong love for the dog, which the dog returns 
with interest. Every one must have noticed how 
miserable horses, dogs, sheep, &c., are when separated 
from their companions, and what strong mutual 
affection the two former kinds, at least, shew on their 
reunion. It is curious to speculate on the feelings of 
a dog, who will rest peacefully for hours in a room 
with his master or any of the family, without the least 
notice being taken of him ; but if left for a short time 
by himself, barks or howls dismally. We will confine 
our attention to the higher social animals ; and pass 
over insects, although some of these are social, and aid 
one another in many important ways. The most 
common mutual service in the higher animals is to 
warn one another of danger by means of the united 
senses of all. Every sportsman knows, as Dr. Jaeger 
remarks,’ how difficult it is to approach animals in a 
herd or troop. Wild horses and cattle do not, I 
believe, make any danger-signal; but the attitude of 
any one of them who first discovers an enemy, warns 
the others. Rabbits stamp loudly on the ground with 
their hind- feet as a signal : sheep and chamois do the 
same with their forefeet, uttering likewise a whistle. 
Many birds, and some mammals, post sentinels, which 
in the case of seals are said ® generally to be the 
females. The leader of a troop of monkeys acts as the 
sentinel, and utters cries expressive both of danger and

of safety.® Social animals perform many little services 
for each other : horses nibble, and cows lick each other, 
on any spot which itches : monkeys search each other 
for external parasites; and Brehm states that after 
a' troop of the Gercopithecus griseo-viridis has rushed 
through a thorny brake, each monkey stretches itself 
on a branch, and another monkey sitting by, ‘^con- 
scientiously ” examines its fur, and extracts every 
thorn or burr. 

Animals also render more important services to one 
another : thus wolves and some other beasts of prey 
hunt in packs, and aid one another in attacking their 
victims. Pelicans fish in concert. The Hamadryas 
baboons turn over stones to find insects, &c. ; and 
when they come to a large one, as many as can stand 
round, turn it over together and share the booty. 
Social animals mutually defend each other. Bull 
bisons in N. America, when there is danger, drive the 
cows and calves into the middle of the herd, whilst 
they defend the outside, I shall also in a future 
chapter give an account of two young wild bulls at 
Chillingham attacking an old one in concert, and of 
two stallions together trying to drive away a third 
stallion from a troop of mares. In Abyssinia, Brehm 
encountered a great troop of baboons who were crossing 
a valley ; some had already ascended the opposite 
mountain, and some were still in the valley : the latter

were attacked by the dogs, but the old males im- 
mediately hurried down from the rocks, and with 
mouths widely opened, roared so fearfully, that the 
dogs quickly drew back. They were again encouraged 
to the attack ; but by this time all the baboons had 
reascended the heights, excepting a young one, about 
six months old, who, loudly calling for aid, climbed on 
a block of rock, and was surrounded. Now one of the 
largest males, a true hero, came down again from the 
mountain, slowly went to the young one, coaxed him, 
and triumphantly led him away — the dogs being too 
much astonished to make an attack. I cannot resist 
giving another scene which was witnessed by this 
same naturalist ; an eagle seized a young Cercopithe- 
cus, which, by clinging to a branch, was not at once 
carried off ; it cried loudly for assistance, upon which 
the other members of the troop, with much uproar, 
rushed to the rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled 
out so many feathers, that he no longer thought of his 
prey, but only how to escape. This eagle, as Brehm 
remarks, assuredly would never again attack a single 
monkey of a troop.^° 

It is certain that associated animals have a feeling 
of love for each other, which is not felt by non-social 
adult animals. How far in most cases they actually 
sympathise in the pains and pleasures of others, is 
more doubtful, especially with respect to pleasures. 

Mr. Belt gives the case of face to face ; and Mr. Belt 
a spider-monkey (Ateles) in believes, from what he has seen 
Nicaragua, which was heard of the habits of these monkeys, 
screaming for nearly two hours that they protect themselves 
in the forest, and was found with from eagles by keeping two or 
an eagle perched close by it. three together. ‘ The Natura-

Mr Buxton, however, who had excellent means of 
observation,'^ states that his macaws, which lived free 
in Norfolk, took “ an extravagant interest ” in a pair 
with a nest ; and whenever the female left it, she was 
surrounded by a troop screaming horrible acclama- 
“ tions in her honour.” It is often difficult to judge 
whether animals have any feeling for the sufferings of 
others of their kind. Who can say what cows feel, 
when they surround and stare intently on a dying Or 
dead companion ; apparently, however, as Houzeau 
remarks, they feel no pity. That animals sometimes 
are far from feeling any sympathy is too certain ; for 
they will expel a wounded animal from the herd, or 
gore or worry it to death. This is almost the blackest 
fact in natural history, unless, indeed, the explanation 
which has been suggested is true, that their instinct or 
reason leads them to expel an injured companion, lest 
beasts of prey, including man, should be tempted to 
follow the troop. In this case their conduct is not 
much worse than that of the North American Indians, 
who leave their feeble comrades to perish on the plains ; 
or the Fijians, who, when their parents get old, or fall 
ill, bury them alive.'^ 

Many animals, however, certainly sympathise with 
each other’s distress or danger. This is the case even 
with birds. Captain Stansbury found on a salt lake 
in Utah an old and completely blind pelican, which

was very fat, and must have been well fed for a long 
time by his companions. Mr. Blyth, as he informs 
me, saw Indian crows feeding two or three of their 
companions which were blind ; and I have heard of an 
analogous case with the domestic cock. We may, if 
we choose, call these actions instinctive ; but such 
cases are much too rare for the development of any 
special instinct.^* I have myself seen a dog, who 
never passed a cat who lay sick in a basket, and was a 
great friend of his, without giving her a few licks with 
his tongue, the surest sign of kind feeling in a dog. 

It must be called sympathy that leads a courageous 
dog to fly at any one who strikes his master, as he 
certainly will. I saw a person pretending to beat a 
lady, who had a very timid little dog on her lap, and 
the trial had never been made before; the little 
creature instantly jumped away, but after the pre- 
tended beating was over, it was really pathetic to see 
how perseveringly he tried to lick his mistress’s face, 
B and comfort her. Brehm states that when a baboon 
in confinement was pursued to be punished, the others 
tried to protect him. It must have been sympathy in 
the cases above given which led the baboons and Cer- 
copitheci to defend their young comrades from the 
dogs and the eagle. I will give only one other instance 
of sympathetic and heroic conduct, in the case of a 
little American monkey. Several years ago a keeper 
j at the Zoological Gardens showed me some deep and 
1 scarcely healed wounds on the nape of his own neck, 

1 inflicted on him, whilst kneeling on the floor, by a

fierce baboon. The little American monkey, wbo was 
a warm friend of this keeper, lived in the same large 
compartment, and was dreadfully afraid of the great 
baboon. Nevertheless, as soon as he saw his friend in 
peril, he rushed to the rescue, and by screams and 
bites so distracted the baboon that the man was able to 
escape, after, as the surgeon thought, running great 
risk of his life. 

Besides love and sympathy, animals exhibit other 
qualities connected with the social instincts, which 
in us would be called moral ; and I agree with 
Agassiz^® that dogs possess something very like a 
conscience. 

Dogs possess some power of self-command, and this 
does not appear to be wholly the result of fear. As 
Braubach remarks, they will refrain from stealing 
foo*d in the absence of their master. They have long 
been accepted as the very type of fidelity and obedience. 
But the elephant is likewise very faithful to his driver 
or keeper, and probably considers him as the leader of 
the herd. Dr. Hooker informs me that an elephant, 
which he was riding in India, became so deeply bogged 
that he remained stuck fast until the next day, when 
he was extricated by men with ropes. Under such 
circumstances elephants will seize with their trunks 
any object, dead or alive, to place under their knees, to 
prevent their sinking deeper in the mud; and the 
driver was dreadfully afraid lest the animal should have 
seized Dr. Hooker and crushed him to death. But the 
driver himself, as Dr. Hooker was assured, ran no 
risk. This forbearance under an emergency so dread-

ful for a heavy animal, is a wonderful proof of noble 
fidelity.^® 

All animals living in a body, which defend them- 
selves or attack their enemies in concert, must indeed 
be in some degree faithful to one another ; and those 
that follow a leader must be in some degree obedient. 
When the baboons in Abyssinia^® plunder a garden, 
they silently follow their leader ; and if an imprudent 
young animal makes a noise, he receives a slap from 
the others to teach him silence and obedience. Mr. 
Galton, who has had excellent opportunities for 
observing the half- wild cattle in S. Africa, says,^® that 
they cannot endure even a momentary separation from 
the herd. They are essentially slavish, and accept the 
common determination, seeking no better lot than to 
be led by any one ox who has enough self-reliance to 
accept the position. The men who break in these 
animals for harness, watch assiduously for those who, 
by grazing apart, shew a self-reliant disposition, and 
these they train as fore-oxen. Mr. Galton adds that 
such animals are rare and valuable ; and if many were 
born they would soon be eliminated, as lions are always 
on the look-out for the individuals which wander from 
the herd. 

With respect to the impulse which leads certain 
animals to associate together, and to aid one another 
in many ways, we may infer that in most cases they 
are impelled by the same sense of satisfaction or 
pleasure which they experience in performing other

instinctive actions ; or by the same sense of dissatis- 
faction as when other instinctive actions are checked. 
We see this in innumerable instances, and it is illus- 
trated in a striking manner by the acquired instincts 
of our domesticated animals ; thus a young shepherd- 
dog delights in driving and running round a flock of 
sheep, but not in worrying them ; a young fox-hound 
delights in hunting a fox, whilst some other kinds of 
dogs, as I have witnessed, utterly disregard foxes. 
What a strong feeling of inward satisfaction must 
impel a bird, so full of activity, to brood day after day 
over her eggs. Migratory birds are quite miserable if 
stopped from migrating ; perhaps they enjoy starting 
on their long flight; but it is hard to believe that the 
poor pinioned goose, described by Audubon, which 
started on foot at the proper time for its journey of 
probably more than a thousand miles, could have felt 
any joy in doing so. Some instincts are determined 
solely by painful feelings, as by fear, which leads to 
self-preservation, and is in some cases directed towards 
special enemies. No one, I presume, can analyse the 
sensations of pleasure or pain. In many instances, 
however, it is probable that instincts are persistently 
followed from the mere force of inheritance, without 
the stimulus of either pleasure or pain. A young 
pointer, when it first scents game, apparently cannot 
help pointing. A squirrel in a cage who pats the nuts 
which it cannot eat, as if to bury them in the ground, 
can hardly be thought to act thus, either from pleasure 
or pain. Hence the common assumption that men 
must be impelled to every action by experiencing some

of any pleasure or pain felt at the moment, yet if it be 
forcibly and abruptly checked, a vague sense of dis- 
satisfaction is generally experienced. 

It has often been assumed that animals were in the 
first place rendered social, and that they feel as a con- 
sequence uncomfortable when separated from each 
other, and comfortable whilst together ; but it is a 
more probable view that these sensations were first 
developed, in order that those animals which would 
profit by living in society, should be induced to live 
together, in the same manner as the sense of hunger 
and the pleasure of eating were, no doubt, first acquired 
in order to induce animals to eat. The feeling of 
pleasure from society is probably an extension of the 
parental or filial affections, since the social instinct 
seems to he developed by the young remaining for a 
long time with their parents; and this extension may 
be attributed in part to habit, but chiefly to natural 
selection. With those animals which were benefited 
by living in close association, the individuals which 
took the greatest pleasure in society would best .escape 
various dangers, whilst those that cared least for their 
comrades, and lived solitary, would perish in greater 
numbers. With respect to the origin of the parental 
and filial affections, which apparently lie at the base of 
the social instincts, we know not the steps by which 
they have been gained ; but we may infer that it has 
been to a large extent through natural selection. So 
it has almost certainly been with the unusual and 
opposite feeling of hatred between the nearest relations, 
as with the worker-bees which kill their brother-drones, 
and with the queen-bees which kill their daughter- 
queens; the desire to destroy their nearest relations

having been in this case of service to the community. 
Parental affection, or some feeling which replaces it, 
has been developed in certain animals extremely low 
in the scale, for example, in star-fishes and spiders. It 
is also occasionally present in a few members alone in 
a whole group of animals, as in the genus Forficula, or 
earwigs. 

The all-important emotion of sympathy is distinct 
from that of love. A mother may passionately love 
her sleeping and passive infant, but she can hardly at 
such times be said to feel sympathy for it. The love 
of a man for his dog is distinct from sympathy, and so 
is that of a dog for his master. Adam Smith formerly 
argued, as has Mr. Bain recently, that the basis of 
sympathy lies in our strong retentiveness of former 
states of pain or pleasure. Hence, “ the sight of 

“ another person enduring hunger, cold, fatigue, 
“ revives in us some recollection of these states, which 
“ are painful even in idea.” We are thus impelled to 
relieve the sufferings of another, in order that our own 
painful feelings may be at the same time relieved. In 
like manner we are led to participate in the pleasures 
of others.^^ But I cannot see how this view explains 
the fact that sympathy is excited, in an immeasurably 
stronger degree, by a beloved, than by an indifferent

person. The mere sight of suffering, independently of 
love, would suffice to call up in us vivid recollections 
and associations. The explanation may lie in the fact 
that, with all animals, sympathy is directed solely 
towards the members of the same community, and 
therefore towards known, and more or less beloved 
members, but not to all the individuals of the same 
species. This fact is not more surprising than that 
the fears of many animals should be directed against 
special enemies. Species which are not social, such 
as lions and tigers, no doubt feel sympathy for the 
suffering of their own young, but not for that of any 
other animal. With mankind, selfishness, experience, 
and imitation, probably add, as Mr. Bain has shown, to 
the power of sympathy ; for we are led by the hope of 
receiving good in return to perform acts of sympathetic 
kindness to others ; and sympathy is much strength- 
ened by habit. In however complex a manner this 
feeling may have originated, as it is one of high im- 
portance to all those animals which aid and defend 
one another, it will have been increased through 
natural selection ; for those communities, which 
included the greatest number of the most sympathetic 
members, would flourish best, and rear the greatest 
number of offspring. 

It is, however, impossible t6 decide in many cases 
whether certain social instincts have been acquired 
through natural selection, or are the indirect result of 
other instincts and faculties, such as sympathy, reason, 
experience, and a tendency to imitation; or again, 
whether they are simply the result of long-continued 
habit. So remarkable an instinct as the placing 
gentinels to warn the community of danger, can hardly 


164 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part I. 


have been the indirect result of any of these faculties ; 
it must, therefore, have been directly acquired. On 
the other hand, the habit followed by the males of some 
social animals of defending the community, and of 
attacking their enemies or their prey in concert, may 
perhaps have originated from mutual sympathy; but 
courage, and in most cases strength, must have been 
previously acquired, probably through natural selec- 
tion. 

Of the various instincts and habits, some are much 
stronger than others ; that is, some either give more 
pleasure in their performance, and more distress in 
their prevention, than others ; or, which is probably 
quite as important, they are, through inheritance, 
more persistently followed, without exciting any special 
feeling of pleasure or pain. We are ourselves conscious 
that some habits are much more difficult to cure or 
change than others. Hence a struggle may often be 
observed in animals between different instincts, or 
between an instinct and some habitual disposition ; as 
when a dog rushes after a hare, is rebuked, pauses, 
hesitates, pursues again, or returns ashamed to his 
master ; or as between the love of a female dog for her 
young puppies and for her master, — for she may be 
seen to slink away to them, as if half ashamed of not 
accompanying her master. But the most curious 
instance known to me of one instinct getting the better 
of another, is the migratory instinct conquering the 
maternal instinct. The former is wonderfully strong ; 
a confined bird will at the proper season beat her breast 
against the wires of her cage, until it is bare and 
bloody. It causes young salmon to leap out of the 
fresh water, in which they could continue to exist, and

thus unintentionally to commit suicide. Every one 
knows how strong the maternal instinct is, leading 
even timid birds to face great danger, though with 
hesitation, and in opposition to the instinct of self- 
preservation. Nevertheless, the migratory instinct is 
so powerful, that late in the autumn swallows, house- 
martins, and swifts frequently desert their tender 
young, leaving them to perish miserably in their 
nests. 

We can perceive that an instinctive impulse, if it be 
in any way more beneficial to a species than some other 
or opposed instinct, would be rendered the more potent 
of the two through natural selection ; for the indivi- 
duals which had it most strongly developed would 
survive in larger numbers. Whether this is the case 
with the migratory in comparison with the maternal 
instinct, may be doubted. The great persistence, or 
steady action of the former at certain seasons of the 
year during the whole day, may give it for a time 
paramount force.

‘ Phil. Ti ansact.’ 1824, and has 
since been confirmed by several 
observers, especially by Mr. 
Blackwall. This latter careful 
observer examined, late in the 
autumn, during two years, 
thirty -six nests ; he found that 
twelve contained young dead

three, eggs not nearly hatched.

The descent oe man. 


Tart 1. 


man is a social being. We see this in his dislike of 
solitude, and in his wish for society beyond that of his 
own family. Solitary confinement is one of the severest 
punishments which can be inflicted. Some authors 
suppose that man primevally lived in single families ; 
but at the present day, though single families, or only 
two or three together, roam the solitudes of some savage 
lands, they always, as far as I can discover, hold 
friendly relations with other families inhabiting the 
same district. Such families occasionally meet in 
council, and unite for their common defence. It is no 
argument against savage man being a social animal, 
that the tribes inhabiting adjacent districts are almost 
always at war with each other ; for the social instincts 
never extend to all the individuals of the same species. 
Judging from the analogy of the majority of the Quad- 
rumana, it is probable that the early ape-like progeni- 
tors of man were likewise social; but this is not of 
much importance for us. Although man, as he now 
exists, has few special instincts, having lost any which 
his early progenitors may have possessed, this is no 
reason why he should not have retained from an 
extremely remote period some degree of instinctive 
love and sympathy for his fellows. We are indeed 
all conscious that we do possess such sympathetic 
feelings but our consciousness does not tell us 
whether they are instinctive, having originated long 
ago in the same manner as with the lower animals, or

whether they have been acquired by each of us during 
our early years. As man is a social animal, it is almost 
certain that he would inherit a tendency to be faithful 
to his comrades, and obedient to the leader of his tribe ; 
for these qualities are common to most social animals. 
He would consequently possess some capacity for self- 
command. He would from an inherited tendency be 
willing to defend, in concert with others, his fellow- 
men ; and would be ready to aid them in any way, 
which did not too greatly interfere with his own 
welfare dr his own strong desires. 

The social animals which stand at the bottom of the 
scale are guided almost exclusively, and those which 
stand higher in the scale are largely guided, by special 
instincts in the aid which they give to the members 
of the same community ; but they are likewise in part 
impelled by mutual love and sympathy, assisted ap- 
parently by some amount of reason. Although man, 
as just remarked, has no special instincts to tell him 
how to aid his fellow-men, he still has the impulse, and 
with his improved intellectual faculties would naturally 
be much guided in this respect by reason and ex- 
perience. Instinctive sympathy would also cause him 
to value highly the approbation of his fellows ; for, as 
Mr. Bain has clearly shewn,^^ the love of praise and the 
strong feeling of glory, and the still stronger horror of 
scorn and infamy, ‘‘ are due to the workings of sym- 
pathy.” Consequently man would be influenced in the 
highest degree by the wishes, approbation, and blame 
of his fellow-men, as expressed by their gestures’ and 
language. Thus the social instincts, which must have 
been acquired by man in a very rude state, and probably

even by bis early ape-like progenitors, still give the 
impulse to some of his best actions ; but his actions are 
in a higher degree determined hy the expressed wishes 
and judgment of his fellow-men, and unfortunately very 
often by his own strong selfish desires. But as love, 
sympathy and self-command become strengthened by 
habit, and as the power of reasoning becomes clearer, 
so that man can value justly the judgments of his 
fellows, he will feel himself impelled, apart from any 
transitory pleasure or pain,- to certain lines of conduct. 
He might then declare — not that any barbarian or 
uncultivated man could thus think — I am the supreme 
judge of my own conduct, and in the words of Kant, I 
will not in my own person violate the dignity of 
humanity. 

The more enduring 'Social Instincts conquer the less 
'persistent Instincts . — We have not, however, as yet 
considered the main point, on which, from our present 
point of view, the whole question of the moral sense 
turns. Why should a man feel that he ought to obey 
one instinctive desire rather than another ? Why is 
he bitterly regretful, if he has yielded to a strong sense 
of self-preservation, and has not risked his life to save 
that of a fellow-creature ? or why does he regret 
having stolen food from hunger ? 

It is evident in the first place, that with mankind 
the instinctive impulses have different degrees of 
strength ; a savage will risk his own life to save that 
of a member of the same community, hut will be 
wholly indifferent about a stranger : a young and 
timid mother urged by the maternal instinct will, 
without a moment’s hesitation, run the greatest danger 
for her own infant, but not for a mere fellow-creature. 


Chap IV. 


'MORAL SENSE. 


169 


Nevertheless many a civilized man, or even boy, who 
never before risked his life for another, but full of 
courage and sympathy, has disregarded the instinct of 
self-preservation, and plunged at once into a torrent to 
save a drowning man, though a stranger. In this case 
man is impelled by the same instinctive motive, which 
made the heroic little American monkey, formerly 
described, save his keeper, by attacking the great and 
dreaded baboon. Such actions as the above appear to 
be the simple result of the greater strength of the 
social or maternal instincts than that of any other 
instinct or motive ; for they are performed too instan- 
taneously for reflection, or for pleasure or pain to be 
felt at the time ; though, if prevented by any cause, 
distress or even misery might be felt. In a timid 
man, on the other hand, the instinct of self-preservation 
might be so strong, that he would be unable to force 
himself to run any such risk, perhaps not even for his 
own child. 

I am aware that some persons maintain that actions 
performed impulsively, as in the above cases, do not 
come under the dominion of the moral sense, and 
cannot be called moral. They confine this term to 
actions done deliberately, after a victory over opposing 
desires, or when prompted by some exalted motive. 
But it appears scarcely possible to draw any clear line 
of distinction of this kind.^^ As far as exalted motives 
are concerned, many instances have been recorded of

Huxley (‘Critiques and Ad- “between material and formal 
dresses,’ 1873, p. 287) takes the “morality is as irrelevant as other 
same view on this subject as 1 “such distinctions.”

Part I. 


savages, destitute of any feeling of general benevolence 
towards mankind, and not guided by any religious 
motive, who have deliberately sacrificed their lives as 
prisoners,^® rather than betray their comrades ; and 
surely their conduct ought to be considered as moral. 
As far as deliberation, and the victory over opposing 
motives are concerned, animals may be seen doubting 
between opposed instincts, in rescuing their offspring 
or comrades from danger ; yet their actions, though 
done for the good of others, are not called moral. 
Moreover, anything performed very often by us, will at 
last be done without deliberation or hesitation, and can 
then hardly be distinguished from an instinct ; yet 
surely no one will pretend that such an action ceases to 
be moral. On the contrary, we all feel that an act 
cannot be considered as perfect, or as performed in the 
most noble manner, unless it be done impulsively, 
without deliberation or effort, in the same manner as by 
a man in whom the requisite qualities are innate. He 
who is forced to overcome his fear or want of sympathy 
before he acts, deserves, however, in one way higher 
credit than the man whose innate disposition leads 
him to a good act without effort. As we cannot dis- 
tinguish between motives, we rank. all actions of a 
certain class as moral, if performed by a moral being. 
A moral being is one who is capable of comparing his 
past and future actions or motives, and of approving or 
disapproving of them. We have no reason to suppose 
that any of the lower animals have this capacity ; 
therefore, when a Newfoundland dog drags a child out

Indians who preferred being Researches,’ 1845, p. 103). 
shot, one after the other, to be-

of the water, or a monkey faces danger to rescue its 
comrade, or takes charge of an orphan monkey, we do 
not call its conduct moral. But in the case of man, 
who alone can with certainty be ranked as a moral 
being, actions of a certain class are called moral, 
whether performed deliberately, after a struggle with 
opposing motives, or impulsively through instinct, or 
from the effects of slowly-gained habit. 

But to return to our more immediate subject. 
Although some instincts are more powerful than others, 
and thus lead to corresponding actions, yet it is 
untenable, that in man the social instincts (including 
the love of praise and fear of blame) possess greater 
strength, or have, through long habit, acquired greater 
strength than the instincts of self-preservation, hunger, 
lust, vengeance, &c. Why then does man regret, even 
though trying to banish such regret, that he has followed 
the one natural impulse rather than the other ; and why 
does he further feel that he ought to regret his con- 
duct ? Man in this respect differs profoundly from the 
lower animals. Nevertheless we can, I think, see with 
some degree of clearness the reason of this difference. 

Man, from the activity of his mental faculties, cannot 
avoid reflection : past impressions and images are 
incessantly and clearly passing through his mind. 
Now with those animals which live permanently in a 
body, the social instincts are ever present and persistent. 
Such animals are always ready to utter the danger- 
signal, to defend the community, and to give aid to 
their fellows in accordance with their habits ; they feel 
at all times, without the stimulus of any special passion 
or desire, some degree of love and sympathy for them ; 
they are unhappy if long separated from them, and

always happy to be again in their company. So it is 
with ourselves. Even when we are quite alone, how 
often do we think with pleasure or pain of what others 
think of us, — of their imagined approbation or dis- 
approbation ; and this all follows from sympathy, a 
fundamental element of the social iifstincts. A man 
who possessed no trace of such instincts would be an 
unnatural monster. On the other hand, the desire to 
satisfy hunger, or any passion such as vengeance, is in 
its nature temporary, and can for a time be fully 
satisfied. Nor is it easy, perhaps hardly possible, to 
call up with complete vividness the feeling, for instance, 
of hunger ; nor indeed, as has often been remarked, of 
any suffering. The instinct of self-preservation is not 
felt except in the presence of danger ; and many a 
coward has thought himself brave until he has met his 
enemy face to face. The wish for another man’s 
property is perhaps as persistent a desire as any that 
can be named ; but even in this case the satisfaction of 
actual possession is generally a weaker feeling than 
the desire : many a thief, if not a habitual one, after 
success has wondered why he stole some article.^’ 


Enmity or hatred seems 
also to be a highly persistent 
feeling, perhaps more so than 
any other that can be named. 
Envy is defined as hatred of 
another for some excellence or 
success ; and Bacon insists 
(Essay ix.), “Of all other 
“ affections envy is the most 
“ importune and continual.” 
Dogs are very apt to hate both 
strange men and strange dogs, 
especially if they live near at 
hand, but do not belong to the 
same family, tribe, or clan ; this 


feeling would thus seem to be 
innate, and is certainly a most 
persistent one. It seems to be 
the complement and converse of 
the true social instinct. From 
what we hear of savages, it 
would appear that something of 
the same kind holds good with 
them. It this be so, it would 
be a small step in any one to 
transfer such feeling.s to any 
member of the same tribe if he 
had done him an injury and had 
become his enemy. Nor is it 
probable that the primitive

A man cannot prevent past impressions often re- 
passing through his mind ; he will thus he driven to make 
a comparison between the impressions of past hunger, 
vengeance satisfied, or danger shunned at other men’s 
cost, with the almost ever-present instinct of sympathy, 
and with his early knowledge of what others consider 
as praiseworthy or blameable. This knowledge cannot 
be banished from his mind, and from instinctive sym- 
pathy is esteemed of great moment. He will then feel 
as if he had been baulked in following a present instinct 
or habit, and this with all animals causes dissatisfaction, 
or even misery. 

The above case of the swallow affords an illustration, 
though of a reversed nature, of a temporary though 
for the time strongly persistent instinct conquering 
another instinct, which is usually dominant over all 
others. At the proper season these birds seem all day 
long to be impressed with the desire to migrate ; their 
habits change; they become restless, are noisy and 
congregate in flocks. Whilst the mother-bird is 
feeding, or brooding over her nestlings, the maternal 
instinct is probably stronger than the migratory ; but 
the instinct which is the more persistent gains the 
victory, and at last, at a moment when her young ones 
are not in sight, she takes flight and deserts them. 
When arrived at the end of her long journey, and the 


conscience would reproach a 
man for injuring his enemy : 
rather it would reproach him, if 
he had not revenged himself. 
To do good in return for evil, 
to love your enemy, is a height 
of morality - to which it may 
be doubted whether the social 
instincts would, by themselves, 


have ever led us. It is necessary 
that these instincts, together 
with sympathy, should have 
been highly cultivated and ex- 
tended by the aid of reason, in- 
struction, and the love or fear 
of God, before any such golden 
rule would ever be thought of 
and obeyed. 


174 


THE DESCENT OF MAN.

migratory instinct has ceased to act, what an agony of 
remorse the bird would feel, if, from being endowed 
with great mental activity, she could not prevent the 
image constantly passing through her mind, of her 
young ones perishing in the bleak north from cold and 
hunger. 

At the moment of action, man will no doubt he apt to 
follow the stronger impulse; and though this may 
occasionally prompt him to the noblest deeds, it will 
more commonly lead him to gratify his own desires at 
the expense of other men. But after their gratification 
when past and weaker impressions are judged by the 
ever-enduring social instinct, and by his deep regard 
for the good opinion of his fellows, retribution will 
surely come. He will then feel remorse, repentance, 
regret, or shame ; this latter feeling, however, relates 
almost exclusively to the judgment of others. He will 
consequently resolve more or less firmly to act differently 
for the future ; and this is conscience ; for conscience 
looks backwards, and serves as a guide for the 
future. 

The nature and strength of the feelings which we 
call regret, shame, repentance or remorse, depend 
apparently not only on the strength of the violated 
instinct, hut partly on the strength of the temptation, 
and often still more on the judgment of our fellows. 
How far each man values the appreciation of others, 
depends on the strength of his innate or acquired 
feeling of sympathy ; and on his own capacity for 
reasoning out the remote consequences of his acts. 
Another element is most important, although not 
necessary, the reverence or fear of the Gods, or Spirits 
believed in by each man : and this applies especially in

cases of remorse. Several critics have objected that 
though some slight regret or repentance may he 
explained by the view advocated in this chapter, it is 
impossible thus to account for the soul- shaking feeling 
of remorse. But I can see little force in this objection. 
My critics do not define what they mean by remorse, 
and I can find no definition implying more than an 
overwhelming sense of repentance. Eemorse seems to 
bear the same relation to repentance, as rage does to 
anger, or agony to pain. It is far from strange that 
an instinct so strong and so generally admired, as 
maternal love, should, if disobeyed, lead to the deepest 
misery, as soon as the impression of the past cause of 
disobedience is weakened. Even when an action is 
opposed to no special instinct, merely to know that our 
friends and equals despise us for it is enough to cause 
great misery. Who can doubt that the refusal to fight 
a duel through fear has caused many men an agony of 
shame ? Many a Hindoo, it is said, has been stirred 
to the bottom of his soul by having partaken of unclean 
food. Here is another case of what must, I think, he 
called remorse. Dr. Landor acted as a magistrate in 
West Australia, and relates,^® that a native on his farm, 
after losing one of his wives from disease, came and 
said that “ he was going to a distant tribe to spear a 
“ woman, to satisfy his sense of duty to his wife. I 
‘‘told him that if he did so, I would send him to 
“ prison for life. He remained about the farm for some 
“ months, hut got exceedingly thin, and complained 
“ that he could not rest or eat, that his wife’s spirit 
‘ was haunting him, because he had not taken a life 

“ ‘ Insanity in Relation to Law ; ’ Ontario, United States, 1871,

‘‘for hers. I was inexorable, and assured him that 
“ nothing should save him if he did.” Nevertheless the 
man disappeared for more than a year, and then re- 
turned in high condition ; and his other wife told Dr. 
Landor that her husband had taken the life of a woman 
belonging to a distant tribe ; but it was impossible to 
obtain legal evidence of the act. The breach of a rule 
held sacred by the tribe, will thus, as it seems, give 
rise to the deepest feelings, — and this quite apart from 
the social instincts, excepting in so far as the rule is 
grounded on the judgment of the community. How so 
many strange superstitions have arisen throughout the 
world we know not ; nor can we tell how some real and 
great crimes, such as incest, have come to be held in 
an abhorrence (which is not however quite universal) 
by the lowest savages. It is even doubtful whether in 
some tribes incest would be looked on with greater 
horror, than would the marriage of a man with a 
woman bearing the same name, though not a relation. 
“ To violate this law is a crime which the Australians 
“hold in the greatest abhorrence, in this agreeing 
“ exactly with certain tribes of North America. When 
“ the question is put in either district, is it worse to 
“ kill a girl of a foreign tribe, or to marry a girl of one’s 
“ own, an answer just opposite to purs would be given 
“ without hesitation.” We may, therefore, reject the 
belief, lately insisted on by some writers, that the 
abhorrence of incest is due to our possessing a special 
God-implanted conscience. On the whole it is intel- 
ligible, that a man urged by so powerful a sentiment

believe serves as an expiation, snch as delivering himself 
up to justice. 

Man prompted by his conscience, will through long 
habit acquire such perfect self-command, that his 
desires and passions will at last yield instantly and 
without a struggle to his social sympathies and in- 
stincts, including his feeling for the judgment of his 
fellows. The still hungry, or the still revengeful man 
will not think of stealing food, or of wreaking his 
vengeance. It is possible, or as we shall hereafter see, 
even probable, that the habit of self-command may, 
like other habits, be inherited. Thus at last man 
comes to feel, through acquired and perhaps inherited 
habit, that it is best for him to obey his more persistent 
impulses. The imperious word ought seems merely to 
imply the consciousness of the existence of a rule of 
conduct, however it may have originated. Formerly it 
must have been often vehemently urged that an insulted 
gentleman ought to fight a duel. We even say that a 
pointer ought to point, and a retriever to retrieve game. 
If they fail to do so, they fail in their duty and act 
wrongly. 

If any desire or instinct leading to an action 
opposed to the good of others still appears, when 
recalled to mind, as strong as, or stronger than, the 
social instinct, a man will feel no keen regret at having 
followed it ; but he will be conscious that if his con- 
duct were known to his fellows, it would meet with 
their disapprobation ; and few are so destitute of 
sympathy as not to feel discomfort when this is realised. 
If he has no such sympathy, and if his desires leading 
to bad actions are at the time strong, and when 
recalled are not over-mastered by the persistent social

instincts, and the judgment of others, then he is 
essentially a bad man ; and the sole restraining 
motive left is the fear of punishment, and the convic- 
tion that in the long run it would be best for his own 
selfish interests to regard the good of others rather 
than his own. 

It is obvious that every one may with an easy con- 
science gratify his own desires, if they do not interfere 
with his social instincts, that is with the good of 
others ; but in order to be quite free from self-reproach, 
or at least of anxiety, it is almost necessary for him to 
avoid the disapprobation, whether reasonable or not, 
of his fellow-men. Nor must he break through the 
fixed habits of his life, especially if these are supported 
by reason ; for if he does, he will assuredly feel dis- 
satisfaction. He must likewise avoid the reprobation 
of the one God or gods in whom, according to his 
knowledge or superstition, he may believe ; but in this 
case the additional fear of divine punishment often 
supervenes. 

The strictly Social Virtues at first alone regarded . — 
The above view of the origin and nature of the moral 
sense, which tells us what we ought to do, and of the 
conscience which reproves us if we disobey it, accords 
well with what we see of the early and undeveloped 
condition of this faculty in mankind. The virtues 
which must be practised, at least generally, by rude men, 
so that they may associate in a body, are those which are

still recognised as the most important. But they are 
practised almost exclusively in relation to the men of 
the same tribe ; and their opposites are not regarded 
as crimes in relation to the men of other tribes. No 
tribe could hold together if murder, robbery, treachery, 
&o., were common; consequently such crimes within 
the limits of the same tribe “ are branded with ever- 
“ lasting infamy ; ” but excite no such sentiment 
beyond these limits. A North-American Indian is 
well pleased with himself, and is honoured by others, 
when he scalps a man of another tribe; and a Dyak 
cuts off the head of an unoffending person, and dries 
it as a trophy. The murder of infants has prevailed 
on the largest scale throughout the world,^^ and has 
met with no reproach; but infanticide, especially of 
females, has been thought to be good for the tribe, or 
at least not injurious. Suicide during former times 
was not generally considered as a crime,^^ but rather, 
from the courage displayed, as an honourable act ; and 
it is still practised by some semi-civilised and savage 
nations without reproach, for it does not obviously

concern others of the tribe. It has been recorded that 
an Indian Thug conscientiously regretted that he had 
not robbed and strangled as many travellers as did 
his father before him. In a rude state of civilisation 
the robbery of strangers is, indeed, generally considered 
as honourable. 

Slavery, although in some ways beneficial during 
ancient times,^^ is a great crime; yet it was not so 
regarded until quite recently, even by the most 
civilised nations. And this was especially the case, 
because the slaves belonged in general to a race 
different from that of their masters. As barbarians 
do not regard the opinion of their women, wives 
are commonly treated like slaves. Most savages are 
utterly indifferent to the sufferings of strangers, or 
even delight in witnessing them. It is well known 
that the women and children of the North-American 
Indians aided in torturing their enemies. Some 
savages take a horrid pleasure in cruelty to animals,^^ 
and humanity is an unknown virtue. Nevertheless, 
besides the family affections, kindness is common, 
especially during sickness, between the members of the 
same tribe, and is sometimes extended beyond these 
limits. Mungo Park’s touching account of the kindness 
of the negro women of the interior to him is well known. 
Many instances could be given of the noble fidelity of 
savages towards each other, but not to strangers ; 
common experience justifies the maxim of the 
Spaniard, “ Never, never trust an Indian.” There 
cannot be fidelity without truth ; and this fundamental

181 


virtue is not rare between the members of tbe same 
tribe : thus Mungo Park beard the negro women 
teaching their young children to love the truth. This, 
again, is one of the virtues which becomes so deeply 
rooted in the mind, that it is sometimes practised by 
savages, even at a high cost, towards strangers ; but to 
lie to your enemy has rarely been thought a sin, as 
the history of modern diplomacy too plainly shews. 
As soon as a tribe has a recognised leader, disobedience 
becomes a crime, and even abject submission is looked 
at as a sacred virtue. 

As during rude times no man can be useful or faith- 
ful to his tribe without courage, this quality has 
universally been placed in the highest rank ; and 
although in civilised countries a good yet timid man 
may be far more useful to the community than a brave 
one, we cannot help instinctively honouring the latter 
above a coward, however benevolent. Prudence, on the 
other hand, which does not concern the welfare of others, 
though a very useful virtue, has never been highly 
esteemed. As no man can practise the virtues necessary 
for the welfare of his tribe without self-sacrifice, self- 
command, and the power of endurance, these qualities 
have been at all times highly and most justly valued. 
The American savage voluntarily submits to the most 
horrid tortures without a groan, to prove and strengthen 
his fortitude and courage ; and we cannot help admir- 
ing him, or even an Indian Fakir, who, from a foolish 
religious motive, swings suspended by a hook buried in 
his flesh. 

The other so-called self-regarding virtues, which do 
not obviously, though they may really, aflfect the wel- 
fare of the tribe, have never been esteemed by savages, 


182 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part I. 


though now highly appreciated by civilised nations. 
The greatest intemperance is no reproach with savages. 
Utter licentiousness, and unnatural crimes, prevail 
to an astounding extent.^® As soon, however, as 
marriage, whether polygamous, or monogamous, 
becomes common, jealousy will lead .to the incul- 
cation of female virtue ; and this, being honoured, will 
tend to spread to the unmarried females. How slowly 
it spreads to the male sex, we see at the present day. 
Chastity eminently requires self-command ; therefore it 
has been honoured from a very early period in the 
moral history of civilised man. As a consequence of 
this, the senseless practice of celibacy has been ranked 
from a remote period as a virtue.^^ The hatred of 
indecency, which appears to us so natural as to be 
thought innate, and which is so valuable an aid to 
chastity, is a modern virtue, appertaining exclusively, 
as Sir G. Staunton remarks,^® to civilised life. This is 
shewn by the ancient religious rites of various nations, 
by the drawings on the walls of Pompeii, and by the 
practices of many savages. 

We have now seen that actions are regarded by 
savages, and were probably so regarded by primeval 
man, as good or bad, solely as they obviously affect the 
welfare of the tribe, — not that of the species, nor that 
of an individual member of the tribe. This conclusion 
agrees well with the belief that the so-called moral 
sense is aboriginally derived from the social instincts, 
for both relate at first exclusively to the community.

The chief causes of the low morality of savages, as 
judged by our standard, are, firstly, the confinement 
of sympathy to the same tribe. Secondly, powers of 
reasoning insufficient to recognise the bearing of many 
virtues, especially of the self-regarding virtues, on the 
general welfare of the tribe. Savages, for instance, 
fail to trace the multiplied evils consequent on a want 
of temperance, chastity, &c. And, thirdly, weak 
power of self-command; for this power has not been 
strengthened through long-continued, perhaps in- 
herited, habit, instruction and religion. 

I have entered into the above details on the im- 
morality of savages, because some authors have 
recently taken a high view of their moral nature, or 
have attributed most of their crimes to mistaken 
benevolence.*® These authors appears to rest their 
conclusion on savages possessing those virtues which 
are serviceable, or even necessary, for the existence of 
the family and of the tribe, — qualities which they un- 
doubtedly do possess, and often in a high degree. 

Concluding Bemarks . — It was assumed formerly by 
philosophers of the derivative school of morals that 
the foundation of morality lay in a form of Selfishness ; 
but more recently the “ Greatest happiness principle 
has been brought prominently forward. It is, how- 
ever, more correct to speak of the latter principle as 
the standard, and not as the motive of conduct. 

See on this subject copious This term is used in an able 

evidence in Chap. vii. of Sir J. article in the ‘ Westminster 
Lubbock, ‘Origin of Civilisa- Review,’ Oct. 1869, p. 498.

Nevertheless, all the authors whose works T have con- 
sulted, with a few exceptions,^^ write as if there must 
be a distinct motive for every action, and that this 
must be associated with some pleasure or displeasure. 
But man seems often to act impulsively, that is from 
instinct or long habit, without any consciousness of 
pleasure, in the same manner as does probably a bee or 
ant, when it blindly follows its instincts. Under cir- 
cumstances of extreme peril, as during a fire, when a 
man endeavours to save a fellow-creature without a 
moment’s hesitation, he can hardly feel pleasure ; and 
still less has he time to reflect on the dissatisfaction 
which he might subsequently experience if he did not 
make the attempt. Should he afterwards reflect over his 
own conduct, he would feel that there lies within him 
an impulsive power widely different from a search after 
pleasure or happiness ; and this seems to be the deeply 
planted social instinct. 

In the case of the lower animals it seems much 


Mill recognises (‘ System of 
liOgic,’ vol. ii. p. 422) in the 
clearest manner, that actions 
may be performed through 
habit without the anticipation 
of pleasure. Mr. H. Sidgwick 
also, in his Essay on Pleasure 
and Desire (‘ The Contemporary 
Peview,’ April' 1872, p. 671), 
l emarks : “ To sum up, in con- 
“ travention of the doctrine that 
“ our conscious active impulses 
“ are always directed towards 
“the production of agreeable 
“ sensations in ourselves, 1 
“would maintain that we find 
“ everywhere in consciousness 
“ extra-regarding impulse, di- 
“ rect 'd towards something that 
“ is not pleasure; that in m iny 


“ cases the impulse is so far in- 
“ compatible with the self-re- 
“garding that the two do not 
“easily co-exist in the same 
“ moment of consciousness.” A 
dim feeling that our impulses 
do not by any means always 
arise from any contemporaneous 
or anticipated pleasure, has, ] 
cannot but think, been one chief 
cause of the acceptance of the 
intuitive theory of morality, and 
of the rejection of the utilitarian 
or “ Greatest happiness ” theory. 
With respect to the latter theory 
the standard and the motive 
of conduct have no doubt often 
been confused, but they are 
really in some degree blended. 


Chap. IV.

more appropriate to speak of their social instincts, 
as liaving been developed for the general good rather 
than for the general happiness of the species. The 
term, general good, may he defined as the rearing of 
the greatest number of individuals in full vigour and 
health, with all their faculties perfect, under the con- 
dition^ to which they are subjected. As the social 
instincts both of man and the lower animals have no 
doubt been developed by nearly the same steps, it 
would be advisable, if found practicable, to use the 
same definition in both cases, and to take as the 
standard of morality, the general good or welfare of the 
community, rather than the general happiness ; but 
this definition would perhaps require some limitation 
on account of political ethics. 

When a man risks his life to save that of a fellow- 
creature, it seems also more correct to say that he acts 
for the general good, rather than for the general 
liappiness of mankind. No doubt the welfare and the 
happiness of the individual usually coincide ; and a 
contented, happy tribe will flourish better than one 
that is discontented and unhappy. We have seen that 
even at an early period in the history of man, the 
expressed wishes of the community will have naturally 
influenced to a large' extent the conduct of each 
member ; and as all wish for happiness, the greatest 
“ happiness principle ” will have become a most im- 
portant secondary guide and object; the social instinct, 
however, together with sympathy (which leads to our 
regarding the approbation and disapprobation of 
others), having served as the primary impulse and 
guide. Thus the reproach is removed of laying the 
foundation of the noblest part of our nature in the 


186 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part I. 


base principle of selfishness ; unless, indeed, the 
satisfaction which every animal feels, when it follows 
its proper instincts, and the dissatisfaction felt when 
prevented, be called selfish. 

The wishes and opinions of the members of the same 
community, expressed at first orally, but later by 
writing also, either form the sole guides of our conduct, 
or greatly reinforce the social instincts ; such opinions, 
however, have sometimes a tendency directly opposed 
to these instincts. This latter fact is well exemplified 
by the Law of Honour, that is, the law of the opinion 
of our equals, and not of all our countrymen. The 
breach of this law, even when the breach is known to 
be strictly accordant with true morality, has caused 
many a man more agony than a real crime. We 
recognise the same influence in the burning sense of 
shame which most of us have felt, even after the 
interval of years, when calling to mind some accidental 
breach of a trifling, though fixed, rule of etiquette. 
The judgment of the community will generally be 
guided by some rude experience of what is best in the 
long run for all the members ; but this judgment will 
not rarely err from ignorance and weak powers of 
reasoning. Hence the strangest customs and super- 
stitions, in complete opposition to the true welfare 
and happiness of mankind, have become all-powerful 
throughout the world. We see this in the horror felt 
by a Hindoo who breaks his caste, and in many other 
such cases. It would be difficult to distinguish 
between the remorse felt by a Hindoo who has yielded 
to the temptation of eating unclean food, from that 
felt after committing a theft; but the former would 
probably be. the more severe. 


Chap. FV.

How so many absurd rules of conduct, as well as so 
many absurd religious beliefs, have originated, we do 
not know ; nor bow it is that they have become, in all 
quarters of the world, so deeply impressed on the mind 
of men ; but it is worthy of remark that a belief 
constantly inculcated during the early years of life, 
whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire 
almost the nature of an instinct ; and the very essence 
of an instinct is that it is followed independently of 
reason. Neither can we say why certain admirable 
virtues, such as the love of truth, are much more 
highly appreciated by some savage tribes than by 
others nor, again, why similar differences prevail 
even amongst highly civilised nations. Knowing how 
firmly fixed many strange customs and superstitions have 
become, we need feel no surprise that the self-regarding 
virtues, supported as they are by reason, should now 
appear to us so natural as to be thought innate, although 
they were not valued by man in his early condition. 

Notwithstanding many sources of doubt, man can 
generally and readily distinguish between the higher 
and lower moral rules. The higher are founded on the 
social instincts, and relate to the welfare of others. 
They are supported by the approbation of our fellow- 
men and by reason. The lower rules, though some of 
them when implying self-sacrifice hardly deserve to be 
called lower, relate chiefly to self, and arise from 
public opinion, matured by experience and cultivation ; 
for they are not practised by rude tribes. 

As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are

united into larger communities, the simplest reason 
would tell each individual that he ought to extend his 
social instincts and sympathies to all the members of 
the same nation, though personally unknown to him. 
This point being once reached, there is only an 
artificial harrier to prevent his sympathies extending 
to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed, such 
men are separated from him by great differences in 
appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shews 
us how^ long it is, before we look at them as our 
fellow-creatures. Sympathy beyond the confines of 
man, that is, humanity to the lower animals, seems to 
be one of the latest moral acquisitions. It is appa- 
rently unfelt by savages, except towards their pets. 
How little the old Komans knew of it is shewn by 
their abhorrent gladiatorial exhibitions. The very 
idea of humanity, as far as I could observe, was new to 
most of the Gauchos of the Pampas. This virtue, one 
of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to 
arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more 
tender and more widely diffused, until they are ex- 
tended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is 
honoured and practised by some few men, it spreads 
through instruction and example to the young, and 
eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion. 

The highest possible stage in moral culture is when 
we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, 
and “ not even in inmost thought to think again the 
sins that made the past so pleasant to us.” What- 
ever makes any had action familiar to the mind, 
renders its performance by so much the easier. As 
Marcus Aurelius long ago said, “ Such as are thy

“ habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of 
“ thy mind ; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.” 

Our great philosopher, Herbert Spencer, has recently 
explained his views on the moral sense. He says,^® 
“ I believe that the experiences of utility organised 
“ and consolidated through all past generations of the 
“ human race, have been producing corresponding 
“ modifications, which, by continued transmission and 
“ accumulation, have become in us certain faculties of 
‘‘ moral intuition — certain emotions responding to right 
“ and wrong conduct, which have no apparent basis in 
“ the individual experiences of utility.” There is not 
the least inherent improbability, as it seems to me, in 
virtuous tendencies being more or less strongly in- 
herited ; for, not to mention the various dispositions 
and habits transmitted by many of our domestic animals 
to their offspring, I have heard of authentic cases in 
which a desire to steal and a tendency to lie appeared 
to run in families of the upper ranks ; and as stealing 
is a rare crime in the wealthy classes, we can hardly 
account by accidental coincidence for the tendency 
occurring in two or three members of the same family. 
If bad tendencies are transmitted, it is probable that 
good ones are likewise transmitted. That the state of 
the body by afiecting the brain, has great influence on 
the moral tendencies is known to most of those who have 
sufi’ered from chronic derangements of the digestion or 
liver. The same fact is likewise shewn by the per- 
“ version or destruction of the moral sense being often 
“ one of the earliest symptoms of mental derange-

“ ment; aud insanity is notoriously often inherited. 
Except through the principle of the transmission of 
moral tendencies, we cannot understand the differences 
believed to exist in this respect between the various 
races of mankind. 

Even the partial transmission of virtuous tendencies 
would be an immense assistance to the primary 
impulse derived directly and indirectly from the social 
instincts. Admitting for a moment that virtuous 
tendencies are inherited, it appears probable, at least 
in such cases as chastity, temperance, humanity to 
animals, &c., that they become first impressed on the 
mental organization through habit, instruction and 
example, continued during several generations in the 
same family, and in a quite subordinate degree, or not 
at all, by the individuals possessing such virtues 
having succeeded best in the struggle for life. My 
chief source of doubt with respect to any such in- 
heritance, is that senseless customs, superstitions, and 
tastes, such as the horror of a Hindoo for unclean 
food, ought on the same principle to be transmitted. 
I ha\e not met with any evidence in support of the 
transmission of superstitious customs or senseless 
habits, although in itself it is perhaps not less 
probable than that animals should acquire inherited 
tastes for certain kinds of food or fear of certain foes. 

Finally the social instincts, which no doubt were 
acquired by man as by the lower animals for the good 
of the community, will from the first have given to 
him some wish to aid his fellows, some feeling of 
sympathy, and have compelled him to regard their

approbation and disapprobation. Such impulses will 
have served him at a very early period as a rude rule 
of right and wrong. But as man gradually advanced 
in intellectual power, and was enabled to trace the 
more remote consequences of his actions ; as he ac- 
quired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful customs 
and superstitions ; as he regarded more and more, not 
only the welfare, but the happiness of his fellow-men ; 
as from habit, following on beneficial experience, in- 
struction and example, his sympathies became more 
tender and widely diffused, extending to men of all 
races, to the imbecile, maimed, and other useless 
members of society, and finally to the lower animals, — 
so would the standard of his morality rise higher 
and higher. And it is admitted by moralists of the 
derivative school and by some intuitionists, that the 
standard of morality has risen since an early period in 
the history of man.^® 

As a struggle may sometimes be seen going on 
between the various instincts of the lower animals, it 
is not surprising that there should be a struggle in 
man between his social instincts, with their derived 
virtues, and his lower, though momentarily stronger 
impulses or desires. This, as Mr. Galton has re- 
marked, is all the less surprising, as man has emerged 
from a state of barbarism within a comparatively 
recent period. After having yielded to some tempta-

tion we feel a sense of dissatisfaction, shame, re* 
pentance, or remorse, analogous to the feelings caused 
by other powerful instincts or desires, when left 
unsatisfied or baulked. AVe compare the weakened 
impression of a past temptation with the ever present 
social instincts, or with habits, gained in early youth 
and strengthened during our whole lives, until they 
have become almost as strong as instincts. If with 
the temptation still before us we do not yield, it is 
because either the social instinct or some custom is at 
the moment predominant, or because we have learnt 
that it will appear to us hereafter the stronger, when 
compared with the weakened impression of the temp- 
tation, and we realise that its violation would cause us 
suffering. Looking to future generations, there is 
no cause to fear that the social instincts will grow 
weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will 
grow stronger, becoming perhaps fixed by inheritance. 
In this case the struggle between our higher and 
lower impulses will be less severe, and virtue will be 
triumphant.

doubt that the difference between the mind of the 
lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense.

though he could form an artful plan to plunder a

a grand natural scene. Some apes, however, would 
probably declare that they could and did admire the 
beauty of the coloured skin and fur of their partners 
in marriage. They would admit, that though they 
could make other apes understand by cries some of 
their perceptions and simpler wants, the notion of 
expressing definite ideas by definite sounds had never 
crossed their minds. They might insist that they 
were ready to aid their fellow-apes of the same troop 
in many ways, to risk their lives for them, and to take 
charge of their orphans ; but they would be forced to 
acknowledge that disinterested love for all living 
creatures, the most noble atHribute of man, was quite 
beyond their comprehension. 

Nevertheless the difference in mind between man 
and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one 
of degree and not of kind. We have seen that the 
senses and intuitions, the various emotions and 
faculties, such as love, memory, attention, curiosity, 
imitation, reason, &c., of which man boasts, may be 
found in an incipient, or even sometimes in a well- 
developed condition, in the lower animals. They are 
also capable of some inherited improvement, as we see 
in the domestic dog compared with the wolf or jackal. 
If it could be proved that certain high mental powers, 
such as the formation of general concepts, self-con- 
sciousness, &c., were absolutely peculiar to man, which 
seems extremely doubtful, it is not improbable that 
these qualities are merely the incidental results of 
other highly-advanced intellectual faculties ; and these 
again mainly the result of the continued use of a 
perfect language. At what age does the new-born

infant possess the power of abstraction, or become 
self-conscious, and reflect on its own existence? We 
cannot answer; nor can we answer in regard to the 
ascending organic scale. The half-art, half-instinct of 
language still bears the stamp of its gradual evolution. 
The ennobling belief in God is not universal with 
man; and the belief in spiritual agencies naturally 
follows from other mental powers. The moral sense 
perhaps afibrds the best and highest distinction be- 
tween man and the lower animals ; but I need say 
nothing on this head, as I have so lately endeavoured 
to shew that the social instincts, — the prime principle 
of man’s moral constitution — with the aid of active 
intellectual powers and fhe efiects of habit, naturally 
lead to the golden rule, “ As ye would that men should 
do to you, do ye to them likewise ; ” and this lies at 
the foundation of morality. 

In the next chapter I shall make some few remarks 
on the probable steps and means by which the several 
mental and moral faculties of man have been gradually 
evolved. That such evolution is at least possible 
ought not to be denied, for we daily see these faculties 
developing in every infant ; and we may trace a perfect 
gradation from the mind of an utter idiot, lower than 
that of an animal low in the scale, to the mind of a 
Newton.

The subjects to be discussed in this chapter are of 
the highest interest, but are treated by me in an im- 
perfect and fragmentary manner. Mr. Wallace, in an 
admirable paper before referred to,^ argues that man, 
after he had partially acquired those intellectual and 
moral faculties which distinguish him from the lower 
animals, would have been but little liable to bodily 
modifications through natural selection or any other 
means. For man is enabled through his mental 
faculties ** to keep with an unchanged body in harmony 
with the changing universe.” He has great power 
of adapting his habits to new conditions of life. He 
invents weapons, tools, and various stratagems to 
procure food and to defend himself. When he migrates 
into a colder climate he uses clothes, builds sheds, and 
makes fires ; and by the aid of fire cooks food otherwise 
indigestible. He aids his fellow-men in many ways,

and anticipates fntnre events. Even at a remote 
period he practised some division of labour. 

The lower animals, on the other hand, must have 
their bodily structure modified in order to survive 
under greatly changed conditions. They must be 
rendered stronger, or acquire more effective teeth or 
claws, for defence against new enemies ; or they must 
he reduced in size, so as to escape detection and 
danger. When they migrate into a colder climate, 
they must become clothed with thicker fur, or have 
their constitutions altered. If they fail to be thus 
modified, they will cease to exist. 

The case, however, is widely different, as Mr. 
Wallace has with justice insisted, in relation to the 
intellectual and moral faculties of man. These 
faculties are variable; and we have every reason to 
believe that the variations tend to be inherited. 
Therefore, if they were formerly of high importance 
to primeval man and to his ape-like progenitors, they 
would have been perfected or advanced through 
natural selection. Of the high importance of the 
intellectual faculties there can be no doubt, for man 
mainly owes to them his predominant position in the 
world. We can see, that in the rudest state of society, 
the individuals who were the most sagacious, who 
invented and used the best weapons or traps, and who 
were best able to defend themselves, would rear the 
greatest number of offspring. The tribes, which 
included the largest number of men thus endowed, 
would increase in number and supplant other tribes. 
Numbers depend primarily on the means of subsistence, 
and this depends partly on the physical nature of the 
country, but in a much higher degree on the arts

which are there practised. As a tribe increases and is 
victorious, it is often still further increased by the 
absorption of other tribes.* The stature and strength 
of the men of a tribe are likewise of some importance 
for its success, and these depend in part on the nature 
and amount of the food which can be obtained. In 
Europe the men of the Bronze period were supplanted 
by a race more powerful, and, judging from their 
sword-handles, with larger hands ; * but their success 
was probably still more due to their superiority in 
the arts. 

All that we know about savages, or may infer from 
their traditions and from old monuments, the history 
of which is quite forgotten by the present inhabitants, 
shew that from the remotest times successful tribes 
have supplanted other tribes. Kelics of extinct or 
forgotten tribes have been discovered throughout the 
civilised regions of the earth, on the wild plains of 
America, and on the isolated islands in the Pacific 
Ocean. At the present day civilised nations are 
everywhere supplanting barbarous nations, excepting 
where the climate opposes a deadly barrier ; and they 
succeed mainly, though not exclusively, through their 
arts, which are the products of the intellect. It is, 
therefore, highly probable that with mankind the 
intellectual faculties have been mainly and gradually 
perfected through natural selection; and this con- 
clusion is sufficient for our purpose. Undoubtedly it 
would be interesting to trace the development of each

separate faculty from the state in which it exists in 
the lower animals to that in which it exists in man ; 
but neither my ability nor knowledge permits the 
attempt. 

It deserves notice that, as soon as the progenitors 
of man became social (and this probably occurred at 
a very early period), the principle of imitation, and 
reason, and experience would have increased, and 
much modified the intellectual powers in a way, of 
which we see only traces in the lower animals. Apes 
are much given to imitation, as are the lowest savages ; 
and the simple fact previously referred to, that after a 
time no animal can be caught in the same place by 
the same sort of trap, shews that animals learn by 
experience, and imitate the caution of others. Now, if 
some one man in a tribe, more sagacious than the 
others, invented a new snare or weapon, or other 
means of attack or defence, the plainest self-interest, 
without the assistance of much reasoning power, would 
prompt the other members to imitate him ; and all 
would thus profit. The habitual practice of each new 
art must likewise in some slight degree strengthen the 
intellect. If the new invention were an important 
one, the tribe would increase in number, spread, and 
supplant other tribes. In a tribe thus rendered more 
numerous there would always be a rather greater 
chance of the birth of other superior and inventive 
members. If such men left children to inherit their 
mental superiority, the chance of the birth of still 
more ingenious members would be somewhat better, 
and in a very small tribe decidedly better. Even if 
they left no children, the trib6 would still include 
their blood-relations; and it has been ascertained by

199 


agriculturists* that by preserving and breeding from 
the family of an animal, which when slaughtered was 
found to be valuable, the desired character has been 
obtained. 

Turning now to the social and moral faculties. In 
order that primeval men, or the ape-like progenitors of 
man, should become social, they must have acquired 
the same instinctive feelings, which impel other 
animals to live in a body; and they no doubt ex- 
hibited the same general disposition. They would 
have felt uneasy when separated from their comrades, 
for whom they would have felt some degree of love ; 
they would have warned each other of danger, and 
have given mutual aid in attack or defence. All this 
implies some degree of sympathy, fidelity, and courage. 
Such social qualities, the paramount importance of 
which to the lower animals is disputed by no one, were 
no doubt acquired by the progenitors of man in a 
similar manner, namely, through natural selection, 
aided by inherited habit. When two tribes of primeval 
man, living in the same country, came into com- 
petition, if (other circumstances being equal) the one 
tribe included a great number of courageous, sympa- 
thetic and faithful members, who were always ready to 
warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each 
other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the 
other. Let it be borne in mind how all-important in 
the never-ceasing wars of savages, fidelity and courage 
must be. The advantage which disciplined soldiers 
have over undisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the 

* I have given instances in my ‘Variation of Animals under 
Domestication,’ vol. ii. p. 196. 


200 THE DESCENT OP MAN. Part I. 

confidence which each man feels in his comrades. 
Obedience, as Mr. Bagehot has well shewn,® is of the 
highest value, for any form of government is better 
than none. Selfish and contentious people will not 
cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected. 
A tribe rich in the above qualities would spread and 
be victorious over other tribes: but in the course of 
time it would, judging from all past history, be in its 
turn overcome by some other tribe still more highly 
endowed. Thus the social and moral qualities would 
tend slowly to advance and be diffused throughout the 
world. 

But it may be asked, how within the limits of the 
same tribe did a large number of members first become 
endowed with these social and moral qualities, and 
how was the standard of excellence raised? It is 
extremely doubtful whether the offspring of the more 
sympathetic and benevolent parents, or of those who 
were the most faithful to their comrades, would be 
reared in greater numbers than the children of selfish 
and treacherous parents belonging to the same tribe. 
He who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a 
savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, 
would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble 
nature. The bravest men, who were always willing to 
come to the front in war, and who freely risked their 
lives for others, would on an average perish in larger 
numbers than other men. Therefore it hardly seems 
probable, that the number of men gifted with such 
virtues, or that the standard of their excellence, could

201 


be increased through natural selection, that is, by the 
survival of the fittest ; for we are not here speaking of 
one tribe being victorious over another. 

Although the circumstances, leading to an increase 
in the number of those thus endowed within the same 
tribe, are too complex to be clearly followed out, we 
can trace some of the probable steps. In the first 
place, as the reasoning powers and foresight of the 
members became improved, each man would soon 
learn that if he aided his fellow-men, he would 
commonly receive aid in return. From this low 
motive he might acquire the habit of aiding his 
fellows ; and the habit of performing benevolent 
actions certainly strengthens the feeling of sympathy 
which gives the first impulse to benevolent actions. 
Habits, moreover, followed during many generations 
probably tend to be inherited. 

But another and much more powerful stimulus to 
the development of the social virtues, is afforded by 
the praise and the blame of our fellow-men. To the 
instinct of sympathy, as we have already seen, it is 
primarily due, that we habitually bestow both praise 
and blame on others, whilst we love the former and 
dread the latter when applied to ourselves; and this 
instinct no doubt was originally acquired, like all the 
other social instincts, through natural selection. At 
how early a period the progenitors of man in the 
course of their development, became capable of feeling 
and being impelled by, the praise or blame of their 
fellow-creatures, we cannot of course say. But it 
appears that even dogs appreciate encouragement, 
praise, and blame. The rudest savages feel the 
sentiment of glory, as they clearly show by preserving 


202 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Pabt I. 


the trophies of their prowess, by their habit of ex- 
cessive boasting, and even by the extreme care which 
they take of their personal appearance and decorations ; 
for unless they regarded the opinion of their comrades, 
such habits would be senseless. 

They certainly feel shame at the breach of some of 
their lesser rules, and apparently remorse, as shewn by 
the case of the Australian who grew thin and could 
not rest from having delayed to murder some other 
woman, so as to propitiate his dead wife’s spirit. 
Though I have not met with any other recorded case, 
it is scarcely credible that a savage, who will sacrifice 
his life rather than betray his tribe, or one who will 
deliver himself up as a prisoner rather than break his 
parole,® would not feel remorse in his inmost soul, if 
he had failed in a duty, which he held sacred. 

We may therefore conclude that primeval man, at a 
very remote period, was influenced by the praise and 
blame of his fellows. It is obvious, that the members 
of the same tribe would approve of conduct which 
appeared to them to be for the general good, and 
would reprobate that which appeared evil. To do 
good unto others — to do unto others as ye would 
they should do unto you — is the foundation-stone of 
morality. It is, therefore, hardly possible to ex- 
aggerate the importance during rude times of the love 
of praise and the dread of blame. A man who was 
not , impelled by any deep, instinctive feeling, to 
sacrifice his life for the good of others, yet was roused 
to such actions by a sense of glory, would by his 
example excite the same wish for glory in other men,

208 


and would strengthen by exercise the noble feeling of 
admiration. He might thus do far more good to his 
tribe than by begetting offspring with a tendency to 
inherit his own high character. 

With increased experience and reason, man perceives 
the more remote consequences of his actions, and the 
self-regarding virtues, such as temperance, chastity, 
&c., which during early times are, as we have before 
seen, utterly disregarded, come to be highly esteemed 
or even held sacred. I need not, however, repeat what 
I have said on this head in the fourth chapter. 
Ultimately our moral sense or conscience becomes a 
highly complex sentiment — originating in the social 
instincts, largely guided by the approbation of our 
fellow-men, ruled by reason, self-interest, and in later 
times by deep religious feelings, and confirmed by 
instruction and habit. 

It must not be forgotten that although a high 
standard of morality gives but a slight or no advantage 
to each individual man and his children over the other 
men of the same tribe, yet that an increase in the 
number of well-endowed men and an advancement in 
the standard of morality will certainly give an immense 
advantage to one tribe over another. A tribe including 
many members who, from possessing in a high degree 
the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, 
and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, 
and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, 
would be victorious over most other tribes; and this 
would be natural selection. At all times throughout 
the world tribes have supplanted other tribes ; and as 
morality is one important element in their success, 
the standard of morality and the number of well-

Part L 


endowed men will thns eyerywhere tend to rise and 
increase. 

It is, however, very difficult to form any judgment 
why one particular tribe and not another has been 
successful and has risen in the scale of civilisation. 
Many savages are in the same condition as when first 
discovered several centuries ago. As Mr. Bagehot has 
remarked, we are apt to look at progress as normal in 
human society ; but history refutes this. The ancients 
did not even entertain the idea, nor do the Oriental 
nations at the present day. According to another 
high authority, Sir Henry Maine, ^ “ the greatest part 
“ of mankind has never shewn a particle of desire that 
“ its civil institutions should be improved.” Progress 
seems to depend on many concurrent favourable con- 
ditions, far too complex to be followed out. But it 
has often been remarked, that a cool climate, from 
leading to industry and to the various arts, has been 
highly favourable thereto. The Esquimaux, pressed 
by hard necessity, have succeeded in many ingenious 
inventions, but their climate has been too severe for 
continued progress. Nomadic habits, whether over 
wide plains, or through the dense forests of the 
tropics, or along the shores of the sea, have in every 
case been highly detrimental. Whilst observing the 
barbarous inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, it struck 
me that the possession of some property, a fixed abode, 
and the union of many families under a chief, were the 
indispensable requisites for civilisation. Such habits 
almost necessitate the cultivation of the ground; and 
the first steps in cultivation would probably result, as

I have elsewhere shewn,® from some such accident as 
the seeds of a fruit-tree falling on a heap of refuse, 
and producing an unusually fine variety. The problem, 
however, of the first advance of savages towards 
civilisation is at present much too difficult to be 
solved. 


Natural Selection as affecting Civilised Nations , — I have 
hitherto only considered the advancement of man from 
a semi-human condition to that of the modern savage. 
But some remarks on the action of natural selection on 
civilised nations may be worth adding. This subject 
has been ably discussed by Mr. W. K. Greg,® and 
previously by Mr. Wallace and Mr. Galton.^® Most 
of my remarks are taken from these three authors. 
With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon 
eliminated ; and those that survive commonly exhibit a 
vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the 
other hand, do our utmost to check the process of 
elimination ; we build asylums for the imbecile, the 
maimed, and the sick ; we institute poor-laws ; and 
our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the 
life of every one to the last moment. There is reason

to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, 
who from a weak constitution would formerly have 
succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of 
civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who 
has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will 
doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of 
man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or 
care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a 
domestic race; but excepting in the case of man 
himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his 
worst animals to breed. 

The aid which we feel impelled to give to the 
helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct 
of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of 
the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the 
manner previously indicated, more tender and more 
widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, 
even at the urging of hard reason, without deteriora- 
tion in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon 
may harden himself whilst performing an operation, 
for he knows that he is acting for the good of his 
patient ; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak 
and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, 
with an overwhelming present evil. We must there- 
fore bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak 
surviving and propagating their kind ; but there 
appears to be at least one check in steady action, 
namely that the weaker and inferior members of 
society do not marry so freely as the sound ; and this 
check might be indefinitely increased by the weak in 
body or mind refraining from marriage, though this is 
more to be hoped for than expected. 

In every country in which a large standing army is

kept up, the finest young men are taken by the con- 
scription or are enlisted. They are thus exposed to 
early death during war, are often tempted into vice, 
and are prevented from marrying during the prime of 
life. On the other hand the shorter and feebler men, 
with poor constitutions, are left at home, and con- 
sequently have a much better chance of marrying and 
propagating their kind.^^ 

Man accumulates property and bequeaths it to his 
children, so that the children of the rich have an 
advantage over the poor in the race for success, 
independently of bodily or mental superiority. On 
the other hand, the children of parents who are short- 
lived, and are therefore on an average deficient in 
health and vigour, come into their property sooner 
than other children, and will he likely to marry earlier, 
and leave a larger number of offspring to inherit their 
inferior constitutions. But the inheritance of property 
by itself is very far from an evil; for without the 
accumulation of capital the arts could not progress j 
and it is chiefly through their power that the civilised 
races have extended, and are now everywhere extending 
their range, so as to take the place of the lower races. 
Nor does the moderate accumulation of wealth interfere 
with the process of selection. When a poor man 
becomes moderately rich, his children enter trades or 
professions in which there is struggle enough, so that 
the able in body and mind succeed best. The presence 
of a body of well-instructed men, who have not to 
labour for their daily bread, is important to a degree 

“ Prof. H. Pick (‘ Einfluss good remarks on this head, and

which cannot he over-estimated ; as all high intellectual 
work is carried on by them, and on such work, material 
progress of all kinds mainly depends, not to mention 
other and higher advantages. No doubt wealth when 
very great tends to convert men into useless drones, 
but their number is never large ; and some degree of 
elimination here occurs, for we daily see rich men, who 
happen to be fools or profligate, squandering away 
their wealth. 

Primogeniture with entailed estates is a more direct 
evil, though it may formerly have been a great 
advantage by the creation of a dominant class, and 
any government is better than none. Most eldest 
sons, though they may be weak in body or mind, 
marry, whilst the younger sons, however superior in 
these respects, do not so generally marry. Nor can 
worthless eldest sons with entailed estates squander 
their wealth. But here, as elsewhere, the relations of 
civilised life are so complex that some compensatory 
checks intervene. The men who are rich through 
primogeniture are able to select generation after 
generation the more beautiful and charming women ; 
and these must generally be healthy in body and 
active in mind. The evil consequences, such as they 
may be, of the continued preservation of the same line 
of descent, without any selection, are checked by men 
of rank always wishing to increase their wealth and 
power; and this they effect by marrying heiresses. 
But the daughters of parents who have produced 
single children, are themselves, as Mr. Galton^^ has 
shewn, apt to be sterile ; and thus noble families are 
continually cut off in the direct line, and their wealth

flows into some side channel; but unfortunately this 
channel is not determined by superiority of any kind. 

Although civilisation thus checks in many ways the 
action of natural selection, it apparently favours the 
better development of the body, by means of good 
food and the freedom from occasional hardships. This 
may be inferred from civilised men having been found, 
wherever compared, to be physically stronger than 
savages.'^ They appear also to have equal powers of 
endurance, as has been proved in many adventurous 
expeditions. Even the great luxury of the rich can be 
but little detrimental; for the expectation of life of 
our aristocracy, at all ages and of both sexes, is very 
little inferior to* that of healthy English lives in the 
lower classes.^* 

We will now look to the intellectual faculties. If in 
each grade of society the members were divided into 
two equal bodies, the one including the intellectually 
superior and the other the inferior, there can be little 
doubt that the former would succeed best in all 
occupations, and rear a greater number of children. 
Even in the lowest walks of life, skill and ability must 
be of some advantage ; though in many occupations, 
owing to the great division of labour, a very small 
one. Hence in civilised nations there will be some 
tendency to an increase both in the number and in the 
standard of the intellectually able. But I do not wish 
to assert that this tendency may not be more than 
counterbalanced in other ways, as by the multiplication

of the reckless and improvident ; but even to such as 
these, ability must be some advantage. 

It has often been objected to views like the fore- 
going, that the most eminent men who have ever lived 
have left no offspring to inherit their great intellect. 
Mr. Galton says,^® I regret I am unable to solve the 
simple question whether, and how far, men and 
“women who are prodigies of genius are infertile. I 
“have, however, shewn that men of eminence are by 
“ no means so.” Great lawgivers, the founders of 
beneficent religions, great philosophers and discoverers 
in science, aid the progress of mankind in a far higher 
degree by their works than by leaving a numerous 
progeny. In the case of corporeal structures, it is 
the selection of the slightly better-endowed and the 
elimination of the slightly less well-endowed indi- 
viduals, and not the preservation of strongly-marked 
and rare anomalies, that leads to the advancement of a 
species.^® So it will be with the intellectual faculties, 
since the somewhat abler men in each grade of society 
succeed rather better than the less able, and con- 
sequently increase in number, if not otherwise pre- 
vented. When in any nation the standard of intellect 
and the number of intellectual men have increased, we 
may expect from the law of the deviation from an 
average, that prodigies of genius will, as shewn by 
Mr. Galton, appear somewhat more frequently than 
before. 

In regard to the moral qualities, some elimination of 
the worst dispositions is always in progress even in 
the most civilised nations. Malefactors are executed,

or imprisoned for long periods, so that they cannot 
freely transmit their bad qualities. Melancholic and 
insane persons are confined, or commit suicide. Violent 
and quarrelsome men often come to a bloody end. 
The restless who will not follow any steady occupation 
— and this relic of barbarism is a great check to 
civilisation — emigrate to newly-settled countries, 
where they prove useful pioneers. Intemperance is so 
highly destructive, that the expectation of life of the 
intemperate, at the age of thirty for instance, is only 
13*8 years; whilst for the rural labourers of England 
at the same age it is 40 • 59 years.^® Profligate women 
hear few children, and profligate men rarely marry; 
both suffer from disease. In the breeding of domestic 
animals, the elimination of those individuals, though 
few in number, which are in any marked manner 
inferior, is by no means an unimportant element 
towards success. This especially holds good with 
injurious characters which tend to reappear through 
reversion, such as blackness in sheep ; and with man- 
kind some of the worst dispositions, which occasionally 
without any assignable cause make their appearance in 
families, may perhaps be reversions to a savage state, 
from which we are not removed by very many genera- 
tions. This view seems indeed recognised in the 
common expression that such men are the black sheep 
of the family.

of morality, and an increased number of fairly good 
men are concerned, natural selection apparently effects 
but little; though the fundamental social instincts 
were originally thus gained. But I have already said 
enough, whilst treating of the lower races, on the 
causes which lead to the advance of morality, namely, 
the approbation of our fellow-men — the strengthening 
of our sympathies by habit — example and imitation — 
reason — experience, and even self-interest — instruction 
during youth, and religious feelings. 

A most important obstacle in civilised countries to 
an increase in the number of men of a superior class 
has been strongly insisted on by Mr. Greg and Mr. 
Gallon,^® namely, the fact that the very poor and 
reckless, who are often degraded by vice, almost in- 
variably marry early, whilst the careful and frugal, 
who are generally otherwise virtuous, marry late in 
life, so that they may be able to support themselves 
and their children in comfort. Those who marry 
early produce within a given period not only a greater 
number of generations, but, as shewn by Dr. Duncan,^® 
they produce many more children. The children, 
moreover, that are born by mothers during the prime 
of life are heavier and larger, and therefore probably 
more vigorous, than those born at other periods. 
Thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious mem- 
bers of society, tend to increase- at a quicker rate than

the proyident and generally yirtuous members. Or as 
Mr. Greg puts the case: ‘‘The careless, squalid, un- 
“ aspiring Irishman multiplies like rabbits : the frugal, 
“foreseeing, self-respecting, ambitious Scot, stern in 
“his morality, spiritual in his faith, sagacious and 
“ disciplined in his intelligence, passes his best years 
“ in struggle and in celibacy, marries late, and leaves 
“ few behind him. Given a land originally peopled by 
“ a thousand Saxons and a thousand Celts — and in a 
“ dozen generations five-sixths of the population would 
“ he Celts, but five-sixths of the property, of the 
“ power, of the intellect, would belong to the one- 
“ sixth of Saxons that remained. In the eternal 
“ ‘ struggle for existence,’ it would be the inferior and 
“ less favoured race that had prevailed — and prevailed 
“ by virtue not of its good qualities but of its faults.” 

There are, however, some checks to this downward 
tendency. We have seen that the intemperate suffer 
from a high rate of mortality, and the extremely 
profligate leave few offspring. The poorest classes 
crowd into towns, and it has been proved by Dr Stark 
from the statistics of ten years in Scotland, that at 
all ages the death-rate is higher in towns than in 
rural districts, “ and during the first five years of life 
“ the town death-rate is almost exactly double that of 
“ the rural districts.” As these returns include both 
the rich and the poor, no doubt more than twice the 
number of births would be requisite to keep up the 
number of the very poor inhabitants in the towns, 
relatively to those in the country. With women, 
marriage at too early an age is highly injurious ; for 

“ ‘ Tenth Annual Report of BirthB, Deaths, &c., in Scotland,’

it has been found in France that, “twice as many 
“ wives under twenty die in the year, as died out of 
“ the same number of the unmarried.” The mortality, 
also, of husbands under twenty is “ excessively high,”^^ 
but what the cause of this may be, seems doubtful. 
Lastly, if the men who prudently delay marrying 
until they can bring up their families in comfort, were 
to select, as they often do, women in the prime of life, 
the rate of increase in the better class would be only 
slightly lessened. 

It was established from an enormous body of sta- 
tistics, taken during 1853, that the unmarried men 
throughout France, between the ages of twenty and 
eighty, die in a much larger proportion than the 
married : for instance, out of every 1000 unmarried 
men, between the ages of twenty and thirty, 11*3 
annually died, whilst of the married only 6*5 died.^^ 
A similar law was proved to hold good, during the 
years 1863 and 1864, with the entire population above 
the age of twenty in Scotland : for instance, out of 
every 1000 unmarried men, between the ages of 
twenty and thirty, 14-97 annually died, whilst of the 
married only 7*24 died, that is less than half.^* Dr. 
Stark remarks on this, “ Bachelorhood is more de- 
“ structive to life than the most unwholesome trades, 

^ These quotations are taken from the same striking paper,

“ or than residence in an unwholesome house or district 
“ where there has never been the most distant attempt 
“at sanitary improvement.” He considers that the 
lessened mortality is the direct result of “ marriage, 
“ and the more regular domestic habits which attend 
“ that state.” He admits, however, that the intem- 
perate, profligate, and criminal classes, whose duration 
of life is low, do not commonly marry ; and it must 
likewise he admitted that men with a weak constitution, 
ill health, or any great infirmity in body or mind, will 
often not wish to marry, or will be rejected. Dr. 
Stark seems to have come to the conclusion that 
marriage in itself is a main cause of prolonged life, 
from finding that aged married men still have a 
considerable advantage in this respect over the un- 
married of the same advanced age; but every one 
must have known instances of men, who with weak 
health during youth did not marry, and yet have 
survived to old age, though remaining weak, and 
therefore always with a lessened chance of life or of 
marrying. There is another remarkable circumstance 
which seems to support Dr. Stark’s conclusion, namely, 
that widows and widowers in France suffer in com- 
parison with the married a very heavy rate of 
mortality ; but Dr. Farr attributes this to the poverty 
and evil habits consequent on the disruption of the 
family, and to grief. On the whole we may conclude 
with Dr. Farr that the lesser mortality of married 
than of unmarried men, which seems to be a general 
law, “ is mainly due to the constant elimination of 
“imperfect types, and to the skilful selection of the 
“ finest individuals out of each successive generation ; ” 
the selection relating only to the marriage state,

and acting on all corporeal, intellectual, and moral 
qualities.^® We may, therefore, infer that sound and 
good men who out of prudence remain for a time 
unmarried, do not suffer a high rate of mortality. 

If the various checks specified in the two last 
paragraphs, and perhaps others as yet unknown, do 
not prevent the reckless, the vicious and otherwise 
inferior members of society from increasing at a 
quicker rate than the better class of men, the nation 
will retrograde, as has too often occurred in the history 
of the world. We must remember that progress is no 
invariable rule. It is very difficult to say why one 
civilised nation rises, becomes more powerful, and 
spreads more widely, than another; or why the same 
nation progresses more quickly at one time than at 
another. We can only say that it depends on an 
increase in the actual number of the population, on 
the number of the men endowed with high intellectual 
and moral faculties, as well as on their standard of 
excellence. Corporeal structure appears to have little 
influence, except so far as vigour of body leads to 
vigour of mind. 

It has been urged by several writers that as high 
intellectual powers are advantageous to a nation, the 
old Greeks, who stood some grades higher in intellect 
than any race that has ever existed,^® ought, if the 
power of natural selection were real, to have risen still 
higher in the scale, increased in number, and stocked

the whole of Europe. Here we have the tacit assump- 
tion, so often made with respect to corporeal structures, 
that there is some innate tendency towards continued 
development in mind and body. But development of 
all kinds depends on many concurrent favourable cir- 
cumstances. Natural selection acts only tentatively. 
Individuals and races may have acquired certain in- 
* disputable advantages, and yet have perished from 
failing in other characters. The Greeks may have 
retrograded from a want of coherence between the 
many small states, from the small size of their whole 
country, from the practice of slavery, or from extreme 
sensuality ; for they did not succumb until ‘‘ they 
“ were enervated and corrupt to the very core.” 
The western nations of Europe, who now so im- 
measurably surpass their former savage progenitors, 
and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or 
none of their superiority to direct inheritance from the 
old Greeks, though they owe much to the written 
works of that wonderful people. 

Who can positively say why the Spanish nation, so 
dominant at one time, has been distanced in the race. 
The awakening of the nations of Europe from the dark 
ages is a still more perplexing problem. At that early 
period, as Mr. Galton has remarked, almost all the 
men of a gentle nature, those given to meditation or 
culture of the mind, had no refuge except in the 
bosom of a Church which demanded celibacy ; and 
this could hardly fail to have had a deteriorating

influence on each successive generation. During this 
same period the Holy Inquisition selected with extreme 
care the freest and boldest men in order to burn or 
imprison them. In Spain alone some of the best 
men — those who doubted and questioned, and without 
doubting there can be no progress — were eliminated 
during three centuries at the rate of a thousand a 
year. The evil which the Catholic Church has thus- 
effected is incalculable, though no doubt counter- 
balanced to a certain, perhaps to a large, extent in 
other ways ; nevertheless, Europe has progressed at an 
unparalleled rate. 

The remarkable success of the English as colonists, 
compared to other European nations, has been ascribed 
to their “ daring and persistent energy ; ” a result 
which is well illustrated by comparing the progress of 
the Canadians of English and French extraction; but 
who can say how the English gained their energy? 
There is apparently much truth in the belief that 
the wonderful progress of the United States, as well 
as the character of the people, are the results of 
natural selection ; for the more energetic, restless, and 
courageous men from all parts of Europe have emi- 
grated during the last ten or twelve generations to 
that great country, and have there succeeded best.^^ 
Looking to the distant future, I do not think that the

“ resulted in the culture of mind in Greece, and that 
“ which resulted in the empire of Eome — only appear 
" to have purpose and value when viewed in connection 
“ with, or rather as subsidiary to ... . the great 
“stream of Anglo-Saxon emigration to the west.” 
Obscure as is the problem of the advance of civilisa- 
tion, we can at least see that a nation which produced 
during a lengthened period the greatest number of 
highly intellectual, energetic, brave, patriotic, and 
benevolent men, would generally prevail over less 
favoured nations. 

Natural selection follows from the struggle for 
existence ; and this from a rapid rate of increase. It 
is impossible not to regret bitterly, but whether 
wisely is another question, the rate at which man 
tends to increase ; for this leads in barbarous tribes to 
infanticide and many other evils, and in civilised 
nations to abject poverty, celibacy, and to the late 
marriages of the prudent. But as man suffers from 
the same physical evils as the lower animals, he has no 
right to expect an immunity from the evils consequent 
on the struggle for existence. Had he not been sub- 
jected during primeval times to natural selection, 
assuredly he would never have attained to his present 
rank. Since we see in many parts of the world 
enormous areas of the most fertile land capable of 
supporting numerous happy homes, but peopled only 
by a few wandering savages, it might be argued that 
the struggle for existence had not been sufficiently 
severe to force man upwards to his highest standard. 
Judging from all that we know of man and the lower 
animals, there has always been sufficient variability in 
their intellectual and moral faculties, for a steady 


220 


THE DESCENT OP MAN. 


Part I. 


advance through natural selection. No doubt such 
advance demands many favourable concurrent cir- 
cumstances ; but it may well he doubted whether the 
most favourable would have sufficed, had not the rate 
of increase been rapid, and the consequent struggle for 
existence extremely severe. It even appears from 
what we see, for instance, in parts of S. America, that 
a people which may be called civilised, such as the 
Spanish settlers, is liable to become indolent and to 
retrograde, when the conditions of life are very easy. 
With highly civilised nations continued progress de- 
pends in a subordinate degree on natural selection ; 
for such nations do not supplant and exterminate one 
another as do savage tribes. Nevertheless the more 
intelligent members within the same community will 
succeed better in the long run than the inferior, and 
leave a more numerous progeny, and this is a form of 
natural selection. The more efficient causes of pro- 
gress seem to consist of a good education during youth 
whilst the brain is impressible, and of a high standard 
of excellence, inculcated by the ablest and best men, 
embodied in the laws, customs and traditions of the 
nation, and enforced by public opinion. It should, 
however, be borne in mind, that the enforcement of 
public opinion depends on our appreciation of the 
approbation and disapprobation of others ; and this 
appreciation is founded on our sympathy, which it can 
hardly be doubted was originally developed through 
natural selection as one of the most important elements 
of the social instincts.®^

O71 the evideme that all civilised nations were once 
harharous . — The present subject has been treated in so 
full and admirable a manner by Sir J. Lubbock, Mr. 
Tylor, Mr. MT<ennan, and others, that I need here 
give only the briefest summary of their results. The 
arguments recently advanced by the Duke of Argyll 
and formerly by Archbishop Whately, in favour of the 
belief that man came into the world as a civilised 
being, and that all savages have since undergone 
degradation, seem to me weak in comparison with 
those advanced on the other side. Many nations, no 
doubt, have fallen away in civilisation, and some may 
have lapsed into utter barbarism, though on this latter 
head I have met with no evidence. The Fuegians 
were probably compelled by other conquering hordes 
to settle' in their inhospitable country, and they may 
have become in consequence somewhat more degraded ; 
but it would be difficult to prove that they have fallen 
much below the Botocudos, who inhabit the finest 
parts of Brazil. 

The evidence that all civilised nations are the 
descendants of barbarians, consists, on the one side, 
of clear traces of their former low condition in still- 
existing customs, beliefs, language, &c. ; and on the 
other side, of proofs that savages are independently 
able to raise themselves a few steps in the scale 
of civilisation, and have actually thus risen. The 
evidence on the first head is extremely curious, but 
cannot be here given : I refer to such cases as that of 
the art of enumeration, which, as Mr. Tylor clearly 
shews by reference to the words still used in some 

” ‘ On the Origin of Civilisa- Nov. 26, 1867.

places, originated in counting the fingers, first of one 
hand and then of the other, and lastly of the toes. 
We have traces of this in our own decimal system, and 
in ' the Eoman numerals, where, after the Y., which 
is supposed to be an ahhrevated picture of a human 
hand, we pass on to YI., &c., when the other hand no 
doubt was used. So again, “ when we speak of three- 
score and ten, we are counting by the vigesimal 
“ system, each score thus ideally made, standing for 
“ 20 — for ‘ one man ’ as a Mexican or Carib would put 
‘‘ it.” According to a large and increasing school of 
philologists, every language bears the marks of its 
slow and gradual evolution. So it is with the art 
of writing, for letters are rudiments of pictorial 
representations. It is hardly possible to read Mr. 
M‘Lennan’s work®® and not admit that almost all 
civilised nations still retain traces of such rude habits 
as the forcible capture of wives. What ancient 
nation, as the same author asks, can be named that 
was originally monogamous? The primitive idea of 
justice, as shewn by the law of battle and other 
customs of which vestiges still remain, was likewise 
most rude. Many existing superstitions are the 
remnants of former false religious beliefs. The 
highest form of religion — the grand idea of God

hating sin and loving righteonsness — was unknown 
during primeval times. 

Turning to the other kind of evidence : Sir J. 
Lubbock has shewn that some savages have recently 
improved a little in some of their simpler arts. From 
the extremely curious account which he gives of the 
weapons, tools, and arts, in use amongst savages in 
various parts of the world, it cannot be doubted that 
these have nearly all been independent discoveries, 
excepting perhaps the art of making fire.^® The 
Australian hbomerang is a good instance of one such 
independent discovery. The Tahitians when first 
visited had advanced in many respects beyond the 
inhabitants of most of the other Polynesian islands. 
There are no just grounds for the belief that the high 
culture of the native Peruvians and Mexicans was 
derived from abroad ; many native plants were there 
cultivated, and a few native animals domesticated. 
We should bear in mind that, judging from the small 
influence of most missionaries, a wandering crew from 
some semi-civilised land, if washed to the shores of 
America, would not have produced any marked effect 
on the natives, unless they had already become some- 
what advanced. Looking to a very remote period in 
the history of the world, we find, to use Sir J. 
Lubbock’s well-known terms, a paleolithic and neolithic 
period ; and no one will pretend that the art of 
grinding rough flint tools was a borrowed one. In all

parts of Europe, as far east as Greece, in Palestine, 
India, Japan, New Zealand, and Africa, including 
Egypt, flint tools have been discovered in abundance; 
and of their use the existing inhabitants retain no 
tradition. There is also indirect evidence of their 
former use by the Chinese and ancient Jews. Hence 
there can hardly be a doubt that the inhabitants of 
these countries, which include nearly the whole civilised 
world, were once in a barbarous condition. To believe 
that man was aboriginally civilised and then suffered 
utter degradation in so many regions, is to take a 
pitiably low view of human nature. It is apparently 
a truer and more cheerful view that progress has been 
much more general than retrogression; that man has 
risen, though by slow and interrupted steps, from a 
lowly condition to the highest standard as yet attained 
by him in knowledge, morals and religion.

Even if it be granted that the difference between man

as some naturalists maintain, and although we must 
grant that the difference between them is immense in 
mental power, yet the facts given in the earlier 
chapters appear to declare, in the plainest manner, 
that man is descended from some lower form, notwith- 
standing that connecting-links have not hitherto been 
discovered. 

Man is liable to numerous, slight, and diversified 
variations, which are induced by the same general 
causes, are governed and transmitted in accordance with 
the same general laws, as in the lower animals. Man 
has multiplied so rapidly, that he has necessarily been 
exposed to struggle for existence, and consequently 
to natural selection. He has given rise to many races, 
some of which differ so much from each other, that 
they have often been ranked by naturalists as distinct

species. His body is constructed on the same homo- 
logical plan as that of other mammals. He passes 
through the same phases of embryological development. 
He retains many rudimentary and useless structures, 
which no doubt were once serviceable. Characters 
occasionally make their re-appearance in him, which 
we have reason to believe were possessed by his 
early progenitors. If the origin of man had been 
wholly different from that of all other animals, these 
various appearances would be mere empty deceptions ; 
but such an admission is incredible. These appear- 
ances, on the other hand, are intelligible, at least to a 
large extent, if man is the co-descendant with other 
mammals of some unknown and lower form. 

Some naturalists, from being deeply impressed with 
the mental and spiritual powers of man, have divided the 
whole organic world into three kingdoms, the Human, 
the Animal, and the Vegetable, thus giving to man a sepa- 
rate kingdom.^ Spiritual powers cannot be compared 
or classed by the naturalist : but he may endeavour to 
shew, as I have done, thnt the mental faculties of man 
and the lower animals do not differ in kind, although 
immensely in degree. A difference in degree, however 
great, does not justify us in placing man in a distinct 
kingdom, as will perhaps be best illustrated by com- 
paring the mental powers of two insects, namely, a coccus 
or scale-insect and an ant, which undoubtedly belong 
to the same class. The difference is here greater than, 
though of a somewhat different kind from, that between

whilst young, attaches itself by its proboscis to a 
plant ; sucks the sap, but never moves again ; is 
fertilised and lays eggs ; and this is its whole history. 
On the other hand, to describe the habits and meiital 
powers of worker-ants, would require, as Pierre Huber 
has shewn, a large volume ; I may, however, briefly 
specify a few points. Ants certainly communicate 
information to each other, and several unite for the 
same work, or for games of play. They recognise their 
fellow-ants after months of absence, and feel sympathy 
for each other. They build great edifices, keep them 
clean, close the doors in the evening, and post sentries. 
They make roads as well as tunnels under rivers, and 
temporary bridges over them, by clinging together. 
They collect food for the community, and when an 
object, too large for entrance, is brought to the nest, 
they enlarge the door, and afterwards build it up again. 
They store up seeds, of which they prevent the ger- 
mination, and which, if damp, are brought up to the 
surface to dry. They keep aphides and other insects 
as milch-cows. They go out to battle in regular bands, 
and freely sacrifice their lives for the common weal. 
They emigrate according to a preconcerted plan. They 
capture slaves. They move the eggs of their aphides, 
as well as their own eggs and cocoons, into warm parts 
of the nest, in order that they may be quickly hatched ; 
and endless similar facts could be given.^ On the 
whole, the difference in mental power between an ant 
and a coccus is immense ; yet no one has ever dreamed

of placing these insects in distinct classes, much less 
in distinct kingdoms. No doubt the difference is 
bridged over by other insects ; and this is not the case 
with man and the higher apes. But we have every 
reason to believe that the breaks in the series are 
simply, the results of many forms having become 
extinct. 

Professor Owen, relying chiefly on the structure of 
the brain, has divided the mammalian series into four 
sub-classes. One of these he devotes to man ; in 
another he places both the Marsupials and the Mono- 
tremata ; so that he makes man as distinct from all 
other mammals as are these two latter groups conjoined. 
This view has not been accepted, as far as I am aware, 
by any naturalist capable of forming an independent 
judgment, and therefore need not here be further 
considered. 

We can understand why a classification founded on 
any single character or organ — even an organ so won- 
derfully complex and important as the brain — or on 
the high development of the mental faculties, is almost 
sure to prove unsatisfactory. This principle has indeed 
been tried with hymenopterous insects ; but when thus 
classed by their habits or instincts, the arrangement 
proved thoroughly artificial.^ Classifications may, of 
course, be based on any character whatever, as on size, 
colour, or the element inhabited ; but naturalists have 
long felt a profound conviction that there is a natural 
system. This system, it is now generally admitted, 
must be, as far as possible, genealogical in arrangement, 
— that is the co-descendants of the same form must be 
kept together in one group, apart from the co-descend- 

^ Westwood, ‘ Modern Class of Insects,’ vol. ii. 1840, p. 87. 


Chap. VI. AFFINITIES AND GENEALOGY. 229 

ants of any other form ; but if the parent-forms are 
related, so will be their descendants, and the two 
groups together will form a larger group. The amount 
of difference between the several groups — that is the 
amount of modification which each has undergone — is 
expressed by such terms as genera, families, orders, 
and classes. As we have no record of the lines of 
descent, the pedigree can be discovered only by ob- 
serving the degrees of resemblance between the beings 
which are to be classed. For this object numerous 
points of resemblance are of much more importance 
than the amount of similarity or dissimilarity in a few 
points. If two languages were found to resemble each 
other in a multitude of words and points of construction, 
they would be universally recognised as having sprung 
from a common source, notwithstanding that they 
differed greatly in some few words or points of con- 
struction. But with organic beings the points of 
resemblance must not consist of adaptations to similar 
habits of life : two animals may, for instance, have had 
their whole frames modified for living in the water, 
and yet they will not be brought any nearer to each 
other in the natural system. Hence we can see how 
it is that resemblances in several unimportant struc- 
tures, in useless and rudimentary organs, or not now 
functionally active, or in an embryological condition, 
are by far the most serviceable for classification; for 
they can hardly be due to adaptations within a late 
period ; and thus they reveal the old lines of descent 
or of true affinity. 

We can further see why a great amount of modifi- 
cation in some one character ought not to lead us to 
separate widely any two organisms. A part which 


230 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part L 


already differs much from the same part in other allied 
forms has already, according to the theory of evolution, 
varied much; consequently it would (as long as the 
organism remained exposed to the same exciting con- 
ditions) he liable to further variations of the same 
kind ; and these, if beneficial, would be preserved, and 
thus be continually augmented. In many cases the 
continued development of a part, for instance, of the 
beak of a bird, or of the teeth of a mammal, would not 
aid the species in gaining its food, or for any other 
object ; but with man we can see no definite limit to 
the continued development of the brain and mental 
faculties, as far as advantage is concerned. Therefore 
in determining the position of man in the natural 
or genealogical system, the extreme development of 
his brain ought not to outweigh a multitude of 
resemblances in other less important or quite un- 
important points. 

The greater number of naturalists who have taken 
into consideration the whole structure of man, in- 
cluding his mental faculties, have followed Blumen- 
bach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate 
Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on 
an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, 
Carnivora, &c. Kecently many of our best naturalists 
have recurred to the view first propounded by 
Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have 
placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, 
under the title of the Primates. The justice of this 
conclusion will be admitted : for in the first place, we 
must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for 
classification of the great development of the brain 
in man, and that the strongly-marked differences 


Chap. VI. 


AFFINITIES AND GENEALOGY. 


231 


between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana 
(lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) 
apparently follow from their differently developed 
brains. In the second place, we must remember that 
nearly all the other and more important differences 
between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly 
adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the 
erect position of man ; such as the structure of his 
hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and 
the position of his head. The family of Seals offers 
a good illustration of the small importance of adaptive 
characters for classification. These animals differ from 
all other Carnivora in the form of their bodies and in 
the structure of their limbs, far more than does man 
from the higher apes ; yet in most systems, from that 
of Cuvier to the most recent one by Mr. Flower,^ seals 
are ranked as a mere family in the Order of the 
Carnivora. If man had not been his own classifier, 
he would never have thought of founding a separate 
order for his own reception. 

It would be beyond my limits, and quite beyond my 
knowledge, even to name the innumerable points of 
structure in which man agrees with the other Primates. 
Our great anatomist and philosopher. Prof. Huxley, 
has fully discussed this subject,® and conclades that 
man in all parts of his organization differs less from 
the higher apes, than these do from the lower mem- 
bers of the same group. Consequently there “is no 
“justification for placing man in a distinct order.” 

In an early part of this work I brought forward 
various facts, shewing how closely man agrees in 

* ‘ Proc. Zoolog. Soc.’ 18(33, p. 4.

Part I. 


constitution with the higher mammals ; and this 
agreement must depend on our close similarity in 
minute structure and chemical composit’xon. I gave, 
as instances, our liability to the same diseases, and to 
dhe attacks of allied parasites ; our tastes in common 
for the same stimulants, and the similar effects pro- 
duced by them, as well as by various drugs, and other 
such facts. 

As small unimportant points of resemblance between 
man and the Quadrumana are not commonly noticed 
in systematic works, and as, when numerous, they 
clearly reveal our relationship, I will specify a few 
such points. The relative position of our features is 
manifestly the same; and the various emotions are 
displayed by nearly similar movements of the muscles 
and skin, chiefly above the eyebrows and round the 
mouth. Some few expressions are, indeed, almost the 
same, as in the weeping of certain kinds of monkeys 
and in the laughing noise made by others, during 
which the corners of the mouth are drawn backwards, 
and the lower eyelids wrinkled. The external ears 
are curiously alike. In man the nose is much more 
prominent than in most monkeys ; but we may trace 
the commencement of an aquiline curvature in the 
nose of the Hoolock Gibbon ; and this in the Semnopi- 
thecus nasica is carried to a ridiculous extreme. 

The faces of many monkeys are ornamented with 
beards, whiskers, or moustaches. The hair on the 
head grows to a great length in some species of 
Semnopithecus ; ® and in the Bonnet monkey {Macacus 
radiatus) it radiates from a point on the crown, with a 
parting down the middle. It is commonly said that 

® Isid. Geoffrey, ‘ Hist. Nat. G^n.’ tom. ii. 1859, p. 217. 


Chap. VI.

233 


the forehead gives to man his noble and intellectual 
appearance; but the thick hair on the head of the 
Bonnet monkey terminates downwards abruptly, and 
is succeeded by hair so short and fine that at a little 
distance the forehead, with the exception of the eye- 
brows, appears quite naked. It has been erroneously 
asserted that eyebrows are not present in any monkey. 
In the species just named the degree of nakedness 
of the forehead difi“ers in different individuals; and 
Eschricht states ’ that in our children the limit between 
the hairy scalp and the naked forehead is sometimes 
not well defined ; so that here we seem to have a 
trifling case of reversion to a progenitor, in whom the 
forehead had not as yet become quite naked. 

It is well known that the hair on our arms tends to 
converge from above and below to a point at the 
elbow. This curious arrangement, so unlike that in 
most of the lower mammals, is common to the gorilla, 
chimpanzee, orang, some species of Hylobates, and even 
to some few American monkeys. But in Hylobates 
agilis the hair on the fore-arm is directed downwards 
or towards the wrist in the ordinary manner ; and in 
U. lar it is nearly erect, with only a very slight for- 
ward inclination ; so that in this latter species it is in 
a transitional state. It can hardly be doubted that 
with most mammals the thickness of the hair on the 
back and its direction, is adapted to throw off the rain; 
even the transverse hairs on the fore -legs of a dog 
may serve for this end when he is coiled up asleep. 
Mr. Wallace, who has carefully studied the habits of 
the orang, remarks that the convergence of the hair 

^ ‘Ueber die Richtung der Haare,’ &c., Muller’s ^Archiv fiir 
Anat. und Phys.’ 1837, s. 61. 


234 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part L 


towards the elbow on the arms of the orang may be 
explained as serving to throw off the rain, for this 
animal during rainy weather sits with its arms bent, 
and with the hands clasped round a branch or over 
its head. According to Livingstone, the gorilla also 
“ sits in pelting rain with his hands over his head.” ® 
If the above explanation is correct, as seems probable, 
the direction of the hair on our own arms offers a 
curious record of our former state ; for no one supposes 
that it is now of any use in throwing off the rain ; nor, 
in our present erect condition, is it properly directed 
for this purpose. 

It would, however, be rash to trust too much to the 
principle of adaptation in regard to the direction of 
the hair in man or his early progenitors ; for it is 
impossible to study the figures given by Eschricht of 
the arrangement of the hair on the human foetus (this 
being the same as in the adult) and not agree with 
this excellent observer that other and more complex 
causes have intervened. The points of convergence 
seem to stand in some relation to those points in the 
embryo which are last closed in during development. 
There appears, also, to exist some relation between the 
arrangement of the hair on the limbs, and the course 
of the medullary arteries.® 

It must not be supposed that the resemblances 
between man and certain apes in the above and in

many other points — such as in having a naked fore- 
head, long tresses on the head, &c. — are all necessarily 
the result of unbroken inheritance from a common 
progenitor, or of subsequent reversion. Many of these 
resemblances are more probably due to analogous 
variation, which follows, as I have elsewhere attempted 
to shew,^® from co-descended organisms having a 
similar constitution, and having been acted on by like 
causes inducing similar modifications. With respect 
to the similar direction of the hair on the fore-arms of 
man and certain monkeys, as this character is common 
to almost all the anthropomorphous apes, it may 
probably be attributed to inheritance ; but this is not 
certain, as some very distinct American monkeys are 
thus characterised. 

Although, as we have now seen, man has no just 
right to form a separate Order for his own reception, 
he may perhaps claim a distinct Sub-order or Family. 
Prof. Huxley, in his last work,^^ divides the Primates 
into three Sub-orders ; namely, the Antbropidac with 
man alone, the Simiadae including monkeys of all 
kinds, and the Lemuridae with the diversified genera 
of lemurs. As far as differences in certain important 
points of structure are concerned, man may no doubt 
rightly claim the rank of a Sub-order ; and this rank 
is too low, if we look chiefly to his mental faculties. 
Nevertheless, from a genealogical point of view it 
appears that this rank is too high, and that man ought 
to form merely a Family, or possibly even only a Sub- 
family. If we imagine three lines of descent proceeding

Part L 


from a common stock, it is quite conceivable that two 
of them might after the lapse of ages he so slightly 
changed as still to remain as species of the same 
genus, whilst the third line might become so greatly 
modified as to deserve to rank as a distinct Sub-family, 
Family, or even Order. But in this case it is almost 
certain that the third line would still retain through 
inheritance numerous small points of resemblance with 
the other two. Here, then, would occur the difficulty, 
at present insoluble, how much weight we ought to 
assign in our classifications to strongly-marked dif- 
ferences in some few points, — that is, to the amount 
of modification undergone ; and how much to close 
resemblance in numerous unimportant points, as indi- 
cating the lines of descent or genealogy. To attach 
much weight to the few but strong differences is the 
most obvious and perhaps the safest course, though it 
appears more correct to pay great attention to the 
many small resemblances, as giving a truly natural 
classification. 

In forming a judgment on this head with reference 
to man, we must glance at the classification of the 
Simiadae. This family is divided by almost all natural- 
ists into the Catarrhine group, or Old World monkeys, 
all of which are characterised (as their name expresses) 
by the peculiar structure of their nostrils, and by 
having four premolars in each jaw; and into the 
Platyrrhine group or New World monkeys (including 
two very distinct sub-groups), all of which are charac- 
terised by differently constructed nostrils, and by having 
six premolars in each jaw. Some other small differences 
might be mentioned. Now man unquestionably belongs 
in his dentition, in the structure of his nostrils, and 


Chap. VI. AFFINITIES AND GENEALOGY. 


237 


some other respects, to the Catarhine or Old World 
diyision ; nor does he resemble the Platyrhines more 
closely than the Catarhines in any characters, except- 
ing in a few of not much importance and apparently of 
an adaptive nature. It is therefore against all pro- 
bability that some New World species should have 
formerly varied and produced a man-like creature, 
with all the distinctive characters proper to the Old 
World division ; losing at the same time all its own 
distinctive characters. There can, consequently, hardly 
be a doubt that man is an off-shoot from the Old World 
Simian stem ; and that under a genealogical point of 
view he must be classed with the Catarhine diyision. 

The anthropomorphous apes, namely the gorilla, 
chimpanzee, orang, and hylobates, are by most natura- 
lists separated from the other Old World monkeys, as 
a distinct sub-group. I am aware that Gratiolet, 
relying on the structure of the brain, does not admit 
the existence of this sub-group, and no doubt it is a 
broken one. Thus the orang, as Mr. St. G. Mivart 
remarks, “ is one of the most peculiar and aberrant 
“forms to be found in the Order.” The remaining 
non-anthropomorphous Old World monkeys, are again 
divided by some naturalists into two or three smaller 
sub-groups ; the genus Semnopithecus, with its peculiar 
sacculated stomach, being the type of one such sub- 
group. But it appears from M. Gaudry’s wonderful 


“ This is nearly the same 
classification as that provisionally 
adopted by Mr. St. George Mi- 
vart (‘ Transact. Philosoj)h. Soc.’ 
1867, p. 300), who, after sepa- 
rating the Lemuridie, divides 
the remainder of the Primates 
into the Hominidse, the Simiadse 


which answer to the Catarhines, 
the Cebida?, and the Hapalidse, — 
these two latter groups answering 
to the Platyrhines. Mr. Mivart 
still abides by the same view ; 
see ‘ Nature,’ 1871, p. 481.

Part I. 


discoveries in Attica, that during the Miocene period 
a form existed there, which connected Semnopithecus 
and Macacus ; and this probably illustrates the manner 
in which the other and higher groups were once 
blended together. 

If the anthropomorphous apes he admitted to form a 
natural sub-group, then as man agrees with them, not 
only in all those characters which he possesses in 
common with the whole Catarhine group, but in other 
peculiar characters, such as the absence of a tail and of 
callosities, and in general appearance, we may infer 
that some ancient member of the anthropomorphous 
sub-group gave birth to man. It is not probable that, 
through the law of analogous variation, a member of one 
of the other lower sub-groups should have given rise to 
a man-like creature, resembling the higher anthropo- 
morphous apes in so many respects. No doubt man, 
in comparison with most of his allies, has undergone an 
extraordinary amount of modification, chiefly in conse- 
quence of the great development of his brain and his 
erect position ; nevertheless, we should hear in mind 
that he “ is but one of several exceptional forms of 
“ Primates.” 

Every naturalist, who believes in the principle of 
evolution, will grant that the two main divisions of the 
Simiadae, namely the Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys, 
with their sub-groups, have all proceeded from some one 
extremely ancient progenitor. The early descendants 
of this progenitor, before they had diverged to any 
considerable extent from each other, would still have 
formed a single natural group ; but some of the species 
or incipient genera would have already begun to indicate 
Mr. St. G. Mivart, ‘Transact. Phil. Soc.’ 1867, p. 410. 


Chap. VI. AFFINITIES AND GENEALOGY. 


239 


by their diverging characters the future distinctive 
marks of the Catarhine and Platyrhine divisions. Hence 
the members of this supposed ancient group would not 
have been so uniform in their dentition, or in the 
structure of their nostrils, as are the existing Catarhine 
monkeys in one way and the Platyrhines in another way. 
but would have resembled in this respect the allied 
Lemuridae, which differ greatly from each other in the 
form of their muzzles, and to an extraordinary degree 
in their dentition. 

The Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys agree in a 
multitude of characters, as is shewn by their unques- 
tionably belonging to one and the same Order. The 
many characters which they possess in common can 
hardly have been independently acquired by so many 
distinct species; so that these characters must have 
been inherited. But a naturalist would undoubtedly 
have ranked as an ape or a monkey, an ancient form 
which possessed many characters common to the Cata- 
rhine and Platyrhine monkeys, other characters in an 
intermediate condition, and some few, perhaps, distinct 
from those now found in either group. And as man 
from a genealogical point of view belongs to the 
Catarhine or Old World stock, we must conclude, 
however much the conclusion may revolt our pride, 
that our early progenitors would have been properly 
thus designated. But we must not fall into the 

error of supposing that the early progenitor of the

THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part L 


whole Simian stock, including man, was identical with, 
or even closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey. 

On the Birthplace and Antiqxdty of Man . — We are 
naturally led to enquire, where was the birthplace of 
man at that stage of descent when our progenitors 
diverged from the Catarhine stock ? The fact that they 
belonged to this stock clearly shews that they in- 
habitated the Old World ; but not Australia nor any 
oceanic island, as we may infer from the laws of geo- 
graphical distribution. In each great region of the 
world the living mammals are closely related to the 
extinct species of the same region. It is therefore 
probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by 
extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpan- 
zee ; and as these two species are now man’s nearest 
allies, it is somewhat more probable that our early 
progenitors lived on the African continent than else- 
where. But it is useless to speculate on this subject ; 
for two or three anthropomorphous apes, one the 
Dryopithecus ” of Lartet, nearly as large as a man, 
and closely allied to Hylobates, existed in Europe 
during the Miocene age ; and since so remote a period 
the earth has certainly undergone many great revolu- 
tions, and there has been ample time for migration on 
the largest scale. 

At the period and place, whenever and wherever it 
was, when man first lost his hairy covering, he probably 
inhabited a hot country ; a circumstance favourable for 
the frugiferous diet on which, judging from analogy, 
he subsisted. We are far from knowing how long ago

it was when man first diverged from the Catarhine 
stock ; but it may have occurred at an epoch as remote 
as the Eocene period ; for that the higher apes had 
diverged from the lower apes as early as the Upper 
Miocene period is shewn by the existence of the Dryo- 
pithecus. We are also quite ignorant at how rapid a 
rate organisms, whether high or low in the scale, may 
be modified under favourable circumstances ; we know, 
however, that some have retained the same form during 
an enormous lapse of time. From what we see going 
on under domestication, we learn that some of the co- 
descendants of the same species may be not at all, some 
a little, and some greatly changed, all within the same 
period. Thus it may have been with man, who has 
undergone a great amount of modification in certain 
characters in comparison with the higher apes. 

The great break in the organic chain between man 
and his nearest allies, which cannot be bridged over by 
any extinct or living species, has often been advanced 
as a grave objection to the belief that man is de- 
scended from some- lower form; but this objection 
will not appear of much weight to those who, from 
general reasons, believe in the general principle 
of evolution. Breaks often occur in all parts of the 
series, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less 
so in various degrees ; as between the orang and its 
nearest allies — between the Tarsius and the other 
Lemuridae — between the elephant, and in a more strik- 
ing manner between the Ornithorhynchus or Echidna, 
and all other mammals. But these breaks depend 
merely on the number of related forms which have 
become extinct. At some future period, not very 
distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of

man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the 
savage races throughout the world. At the same time 
the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen 
has remarked,^® will no doubt he exterminated. The 
break between man and his nearest allies will then be 
wider, for it will intervene between man in a more 
civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Cauca- 
sian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as 
now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla. 

With respect to the absence of fossil remains, serving 
to connect man with his ape-like progenitors, no one 
will lay much stress on this fact who reads Sir C. 
Lyell’s discussion,^^ where he shews that in all the 
vertebrate classes the discovery of fossil remains has 
been a very slow and fortuitous process. Nor should 
it be forgotten that those regions which are the most 
likely to afford remains connecting man with some 
extinct ape-like creature, have not as yet been searched 
by geologists. 

Lower Stages in the Genealogy of Man . — We have 
seen that man appears to have diverged from the 
Catarhine or Old World division of the Simiadse, after 
these had diverged from the New World division. We 
will now endeavour to follow the remote traces of his 
genealogy, trusting principally to the mutual affinities 
between the various classes and orders, with some 
slight reference to the periods, as far as ascertained, 
of their successive appearance on the earth. The

according to Hiickel and others, a distinct Order. 
This group is diversified and broken to an extra- 
ordinary degree, and includes many aberrant forms. 
It has, therefore, probably suffered much extinction. 
Most of the remnants survive on islands, such as 
Madagascar and the Malayan archipelago, where they 
have not been exposed to so severe a competition as 
they would have been on well-stocked continents. 
This group likewise presents many gradations, leading, 
as Huxley remarks,^® “ insensibly from the crown and 
“ summit of the animal creation down to creatures 
“ from which there is but a step, as it seems, to the 
“ lowest, smallest, and least intelligent of the placental 
“ mammalia.” From these various considerations it is 
probable that the Simiadm were originally developed 
from the progenitors of the existing Lemuridae ; and 
these in their turn from forms standing very low in 
the mammalian series. 

The Marsupials stand in many important characters 
below the placental mammals. They appeared at an 
earlier geological period, and their range was formerly 
much more extensive than at present. Hence the 
Placentata are generally supposed to have been derived 
from the Implacentata or Marsupials ; not, however, 
from forms closely resembling the existing Marsupials, 
but from their early progenitors. The Monotremata 
are plainly allied to the Marsupials, forming a third 
and still lower division in the great mammalian series. 
They are represented at the present day solely by the 
Ornithorhynchus and Echidna ; and these two forms 
may be safely considered as relics of a much larger 
group, representatives of which have been preserved in

Australia through some favourable concurrence of 
circumstances. The Monotremata are eminently in- 
teresting, as leading in several important points of 
structure towards the class of reptiles. 

In attempting to trace the genealogy of the Mam- 
malia, and therefore of man, lower down in the series, 
we become involved in greater and greater obscurity ; 
but as a most capable judge, Mr. Parker, has remarked, 
we have good reason to believe, that no true bird or 
reptile intervenes in the direct line of descent. He 
who wishes to see what ingenuity and knowledge can 
effect, may consult Prof. Hackel’s works.^^ I will 
content myself with a few general remarks. Every 
evolutionist will admit that the five great vertebrate 
classes, namely, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, 
and fishes, are descended from some one prototype ; 
for they have much in common, especially during their 
embryonic state. As the class of fishes is the most 
lowly organised, and appeared before the others, we 
may conclude that all the members of the . vertebrate 
kingdom are derived from some fishlike animal. The 
belief that animals so distinct as a monkey, an elephant, 
a humming-bird, a snake, a frog, and a fish, &c., could 
all have sprung from the same parents, will appear 
monstrous to those who have not attended to the recent 
progress of natural history. For this belief implies

Huxley, in reviewing this latter

phylum or lines of descent of 
the Vertebrata to be admirably 
discussed by Hackel, although 
he difters on some points. He 
expresses, also, his high estimate 
of the general tenor and spirit of 
the whole work.

the former existence of links binding closely together 
all these forms, now so utterly unlike. 

Nevertheless, it is certain that groups of animals 
have existed, or do now exist, which serve to connect 
several of the great vertebrate classes more or less 
closely. We have seen that the Ornithorhynchus 
graduates towards reptiles ; and Prof. Huxley has 
discovered, and is confirmed by Mr. Cope and others, 
that the Dinosaurians are in many important characters 
intermediate between certain reptiles and certain birds 
— the birds referred to being the ostrich-tribe (itself 
evidently a widely-diffused remnant of a larger group) 
and the Archeopteryx, that strange Secondary bird, 
with a long lizard-like tail. Again, according to Prof. 
Owen,^^ the Ichthyosaurians — great sea-lizards fur- 
nished with paddles — present many affinities with 
fishes, or rather, according to Huxley, with amphibians ; 
a class which, including in its highest division frogs 
and toads, is plainly allied to the Ganoid fishes. These 
latter fishes swarmed during the earlier geological 
periods, and were constructed on what is called a gene- 
ralised type, that is, they presented diversified affini- 
ties with other groups of organisms. The Lepidosiren 
is also so closely allied to amphibians and fishes, that 
naturalists long disputed in which of these two classes 
to rank it ; it, and also some few Ganoid fishes, have 
been preserved from utter extinction by inhabiting 
rivers, which are harbours of refuge, and are related 
to the great waters of the ocean in the same way that 
islands are to continents. 

Lastly, one single member of the immense and 
diversified class of fishes, namely, the lancelet or 
“ ‘ Palaeontology,’ 1860, p. 199. 


246 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part I. 


amphioxus, is so different from all other fishes, that 
Hackel maintains that it ought to form a distinct class 
in the vertebrate kingdom. This fish is remarkable 
for its negative characters ; it can hardly be said to 
possess a brain, vertebral column, or heart, &c. ; so 
that it was classed by the older naturalists amongst 
the worms. Many years ago Prof. Goodsir perceived 
that the lancelet presented some affinities with the 
Ascidians, which are invertebrate, hermaphrodite, 
marine creatures permanently attached to a support. 
They hardly appear like animals, and consist of a 
simple, tough, leathery sack, with two small projecting 
orifices. They belong to the Mulluscoida of Huxley — 
a lower division of the great kingdom of the Mollusca ; 
but they have recently been placed by some naturalists 
amongst the Vermes or worms. Their larvae somewhat 
resemble tadpoles in shape,^^ and have the power of 
swimming freely about. M. Kovalevsky has lately 
observed that the larvae of Ascidians are related to the 
Vertebrata, in their manner of development, in the 
relative position of the nervous system, and in possess- 
ing a structure closely like the chorda dorsalis of 
vertebrate animals ; and in this he has been since 
confirmed by Prof. Kupffer. M. Kovalevsky writes to 


^ At the Falkland Islands I 
had the satisfaction of seeing, 
in April 1833, and therefore sorce 
years before any other naturalist, 
the locomotive larvas of a com- 
pound Ascidian, closely allied to 
Synoicum, but apparently generi- 
cally distinct from it. The tail 
was about five times as long as 
the oblong head, and terminated 
in a very tine filament. 1 1 was, as 
sketched by me under a simple 


microscope, plainly divided by 
transverse opaque partitions, 
which I presume represent the 
great cells figured by Kovalev- 
sky. At an early stage of de- 
velopment the tail was closely 
coiled round the head of the 
larva.

me from Naples, that he has now carried these observa- 
tions yet further, and should his results be well estab- 
lished, the whole will form a discovery of the very greatest 
value. Thus, if we may rely on embryology, ever the 
safest guide in classification, it seems that we have at 
last gained a clue to the source whence the Yertebrata 
were derived.^^ We should then be justified in be- 
lieving that at an extremely remote period a group of 
animals existed, resembling in many respects the larvae 
of our present Ascidians, which diverged into two 
great branches — the one retrograding in development 
and producing the present class of Ascidians, the other 
rising to the crown and summit of the animal kingdom 
by giving birth to the Yertebrata. 

We have thus far endeavoured rudely to trace the 
genealogy of the Yertebrata by the aid of their mutual 
affinities. We will now look to man as he exists ; and 
we shall, I think, be able partially to restore the 
structure of our early progenitors, during successive 
periods, but not in due order of time. This can be 
effected by n.eans of the rudiments which man still 
retains, by the characters which occasionally make 
their appearance in him through reveision, and by 
the aid of the principles of morphology and embryology. 


“ But I am bound to add 
that some competent judges dis- 
pute this conclusion; for instance, 
M. Giard, in a series of } apers in 
the ‘ Archives de Zoologie Ex- 
peiimentale,’ for 1872. Never- 
theless, this naturalist remarks,

248 THE DESCENT OF MAN. Part I 

The various facts, to which I shall here allude, have 
been given in the previous chapters. 

The early progenitors of man must have been once 
covered with hair, both sexes having beards; their 
ears were probably pointed, and capable of movement ; 
and their bodies were provided with a tail, having the 
proper muscles. Their limbs and bodies were also 
acted on by many muscles which now only occasionally 
reappear, but are normally present in the Quadru- 
mana. At this or some earlier period, the great artery 
and nerve of the humerus ran through a supra- 
condyloid foramen. The intestine gave forth a much 
larger diverticulum or caecum than that now existing. 
The foot was then prehensile, judging from the con- 
dition of the great toe. in the foetus ; and our pro- 
genitors, no doubt, were arboreal in their habits, and 
frequented some warm, forest-clad land. The males 
had great canine teeth, which served them as formidable 
weapons. At a much earlier period the uterus was 
double ; the excreta were voided through a cloaca ; and 
the eye was protected by a third eyelid or nictitating 
membrane. At a still earlier the progenitors of man 
must have been aquatic in their habits ; for morphology 
plainly tells us that our lungs consist of a modified 
swim-bladder, which once served as a float. The clefts 
on the neck in the embryo of man show where the 
branchiae once existed. In the lunar or weekly re- 
current periods of some of our functions we apparently 
still retain traces of our primordial birthplace, a shore 
washed by the tides. At about this same early period 
the true kidneys were replaced by the corpora wolffiana. 
The heart existed as a simple pulsating vessel; and 
the chorda dorsalis took the place of a vertebral

column. These early ancestors of man, thus seen in 
the dim recesses of tinm, must have been as simply, or 
even still more simply organised than the lancelet or 
amphioxus. 

There is one other point deserving a fuller notice. 
It has long been known that in the vertebrate kingdom 
one sex bears rudiments of various accessory parts, 
appertaining to the reproductive system, which pro- 
perly belong to the opposite sex ; and it has now been 
ascertained that at a very early embryonic period both 
sexes possess true male and female glands. Hence 
some remote progenitor of the whole vertebrate king- 
dom appears to have been hermaphrodite or andro- 
gynous.^® But here we encounter a singular diflSculty. 
In the mammalian class the males possess rudiments 
of a uterus with the adjacent passage, in their vesiculae 
prostaticae ; they bear also rudiments of mammae, and 
some male Marsupials have traces of a marsupial sack.^^ 
Other analogous facts could be added. Are we, then, 
to s appose that some extremely ancient mammal con- 
tinued androgynous, after it had acquired the chief 
distinctions of its class, and therefore after it had 
diverged from the lower classes of the vertebrate 
kingdom ? This seems very improbable, for we have 
to look to fishes, the lowest of all the classes, to find any 


“ This is the conclusion of 
Prof. Gegenbaur, one of the 
highest authorities in compara- 
tive anatomy; see ‘Grundziige 
der vergleich. Anat.’ 1870, s. 
876. The result has been ar- 
rived at chiefly from the study 
of the Amphibia ; but it appears 
from the researches of Waldeyer 
(as quoted in ‘ Journal of Anat. 
and Phys.’ 1869, p. 161), that 


the sexual organs of even “ the 
“ higher vertebrata are, in their 
“early condition, hermaphro- 
dite.” Similar views have long 
been held by some authors, 
though until recently without 
a firm basis.

still existent androgynous forms. That various acces- 
sory parts, proper to each sex, are found in a rudimen- 
tary condition in the opposite sex, may be explained by 
such organs having been gradually acquired by the one 
sex, and then transmitted in a more or less imperfect 
state to the other. When we treat of sexual selection, 
we shall meet with innumerable instances of this form 
of transmission, — as in the case of the spurs, plumes, 
and brilliant colours, acquired for battle or ornament 
by male birds, and inherited by the females in an 
imperfect or rudimentary condition. 

The possession by male mammals of functionally 
imperfect mammary organs is, in some respects, 
especially curious. The Monotremata have the proper 
milk-secreting glands with orifices, but no nipples ; 
and as these animals stand at the very base of the 
mammalian series, it is probable that the progenitors 
of the class also had milk-secreting glands, but no 
‘ nipples. This conclusion is supported by what is 
known of their manner of development ; for Professor 
Turner informs me, on the authority of Kblliker and 
Langer, that in the embryo the mammary glands can 
be distinctly traced before the nipples are in the least 
visible ; and the development of successive parts in the 
individual generally represents and accords with the

observed in several specus of

ences on this subject, more es. 
pecially to a paper by Prof. Hal- 
bertsma,in the ‘Transact, of the 
Dutch Acad, of Sciences,’ vol. 


xvi. Dr. Gunther doubts the 
fact, but it has now been re- 
corded by too many good ob- 
servers to be any longer disputed. 
Dr. M. Lessona writes to me, 
that he has verified the observa- 
tions made by Cavolini on Ser- 
ranus. Prof. Ercolani has re- 
cently shewn (‘ Accad. delle 
Scienze,’ Bologna, Dec. 28, 1871) 
that eels are androgynous.

development of successive beings in the same line of 
descent. The Marsupials differ from the Monotremata 
by possessing nipples ; so that probably these organs 
were first acquired by the Marsupials, after they had 
diverged from, and risen above, the Monotremata, and 
were then transmitted to the placental mammals.^® 
No one will suppose that the Marsupials still remained 
androgynous, after they had approximately acquired 
their present structure. How then are we to account 
for male mammals possessing mammae ? It is possible 
that they were first developed in the females and then 
transferred to the males, but from what follows this is 
hardly probable. 

It may be suggested, as another view, that long 
after the progenitors of the whole mammalian class 
had ceased to be androgynous, both sexes yielded milk, 
and thus nourished their young; and in the case of 
the Marsupials, that both sexes carried their young 
marsupial sacks. This will not appear altogether 
improbable, if we reflect that the males of existing 
syngnathous fishes receive the eggs of the females in 
their abdominal pouches, hatch them, and afterwards, 
as some believe, nourish the young ; — that certain 


^ Prof. Gegenbaur has shewn 
(‘Jenaische Zeitschrift,’ Bd. vii. 
p. 212) that two distinct types 
of nipples prevail throughout the 
several mammalian orders, but 
that it is quite intelligible how 
both could have been derived 
from the nipples of the ]\Iar- 
supials, and the latter from those 
of the Monotremata. See, also, 
a memoir by Dr. Max Huss, on 
the mammary glands, ibid. B. 
viii. p. 176. 


^ Mr. Lockwood believes (as 
noted in ‘Quart. Journal of 
cience,’ April, 1868, p. 269), 
from what he has observed of 
the development of Hippo- 
campus, that the walls of the 
abdominal pouch of the male in 
some way afford nourishment.

in their mouths, see a very in- 
teresting paper by Prof. Wyman,

other male fishes hatch the eggs within their mouths 
or branchial cavities ; — that certain male toads take 
the chaplets of eggs from the females, and wind them 
round their own thighs, keeping them there until the 
tadpoles are born ; — that certain male birds undertake 
the whole duty of incubation, and that male pigeons, 
as well as the females, feed their nestlings with a 
secretion from their crops. But the above suggestion 
first occurred to me from the mammary glands of male 
mammals being so much more perfectly developed than 
the rudiments of the other accessory reproductive parts, 
which are found in the one sex though proper to the 
other. The mammary glands and nipples, as they 
exist in male mammals, can indeed hardly he called 
rudimentary ; they are merely not fully developed, and 
not functionally active. They are sympathetically 
affected under the influence of certain diseases, like the 
same organs in the female. They often secrete a few 
drops of milk at birth and at puberty : this latter fact 
occurred in the curious case, before referred to, where a 
young man possessed two pairs of mammae. In man 
and some other male mammals these organs have been 
known occasionally to become so well developed during 
maturity as to yield a fair supply of milk. Now if we 
suppose that during a former prolonged period male 
mammals aided the females in nursing their off- 
spring, and that afterwards from some cause (as from 
the production of a smaller number of young) the males 
ceased to give this aid, disuse of the organs during

253 


maturity would lead to their becoming inactive ; and 
from two well-known principles of inheritance, this 
state of inactivity would probably be transmitted to 
the males at the corresponding age of maturity. But 
at an earlier age these organs would be left unaffected, 
so that they would be almost equally well developed in 
the young of both sexes. 

Conclusion . — Yon Baer has defined advancement or 
progress in the organic scale better than any one else, 
as resting on the amount of differentiation and speciali- 
sation of the several parts of a being, — when arrived 
at maturity, as I should be inclined to add. Now as 
organisms have become slowly adapted to diversified 
lines of life by means of natural selection, their parts 
will have become more and more differentiated and 
specialised for various functions from the advantage 
gained by the division of physiological labour. The 
same part appears often to have been modified first for 
one purpose, and then long afterwards for some other 
and quite distinct purpose ; and thus all the parts are 
rendered more and more complex. But each organism 
still retains the general type of structure of the pro- 
genitor from which it was aboriginally derived. In ac- 
cordance with this view it seems, if we turn to geo- 
logical evidence, that organisation on the whole has 
advanced throughout the world by slow and interrupted 
steps. In the great kingdom of the Yertebrata it has 
culminated in man. It must not, however, be supposed 
that groups of organic beings are always supplanted, 
and disappear as soon as they have given birth to other 
and more perfect groups. The latter, though victorious 
over their predecessors, may not have become better

adapted for all places in the economy of nature. Some 
old forms appear to have survived from inhabiting 
protected sites, where they have not been exposed to 
very severe competition ; and these often aid us in 
constructing our genealogies, by giving us a fair idea 
of former and lost populations. But we must not fall 
into the error of looking at the existing members of 
any lowly-organised group as perfect representatives of 
their ancient predecessors. 

The most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of the 
Vertebrata, at which we are able to obtain an obscure 
glance, apparently consisted of a group of marine 
animals, resembling the larvae of existing Ascidians. 


The inhabitants of the sea- 
shore must be greatly affected by 
the tides ; animals living either 
aboutthe mean high-water mark, 
or about the mean low-water 
mark, pass through a complete 
cycle of tidal changes in a fort- 
night. Consequently, their food 
supply will undergo marked 
changes week by week. The 
vital functions of such animals, 
living under these conditions for 
many generations, can hardly fail 
to run their course in regular 
weekly periods. Now it is a 
mysterious fact that in the 
higher and now terrestrial Ver- 
tebrata, as well as in other 
classes, many normal and abnor- 
mal processes have one or more 
whole ^veeks as their periods; 
this would be rendered intelligible 
if the Vertebrata are descended 
from an animal allied to the 
existing tidal Ascidians. Many 
instances of such periodic pro- 
cesses might be given, as the 
gestation of mammals, the dura- 


tion of fevers, &c. The hatching 
of eggs affords also a good ex- 
ample, for, according to Mr. 
Bartlett (‘ Land and Water,’ Jan. 
7, 1871), the eggs of the pigeon 
are hatched in two weeks ; tliose 
of the fowl in three ; those of the 
duck in four ; those of the goose 
in five ; and those of the ostrich 
in seven weeks. As far as we can 
judge, a recurrent period, if ap- 
proximately of the right duration 
for any process or function, would 
not, when once gained, be liable 
to change ; consequently it might 
be thus transmitted through al- 
most any number of generations. 
But if the function changed, the 
period would have to change, and 
would be apt to change almost 
abruptly by a whole week. This 
conclusion, if sound, is highly re- 
markable ; for the period of ges- 
tation in each mammal, and the 
hatching of each bird’s eggs, 
and many other vital processes, 
thus betray to us the primordial 
birthplace of these animals.

These animals probably gave rise to a group of fishes, 
as lowly organised as the lancelet ; and from these the 
Ganoids, and other fishes like the Lepidosiren, must 
have been developed. From such fish a very small 
advance would carry us on to the Amphibians. We 
have seen that birds and reptiles were once intimately 
connected together ; and the Monotremata now connect 
mammals with reptiles in a slight degree. But no one 
can at present say by what line of descent the three 
higher and related classes, namely, mammals, birds, 
and reptiles, were derived from the two lower vertebrate 
classes, namely, amphibians and fishes. In the class of 
mammals the steps are not difficult to conceive which 
led from the ancient Monotremata to the ancient 
Marsupials ; and from these to the early progenitors of 
the placental mammals. We may thus ascend to the 
Lemuridas ; and the interval is not very wide from 
these to the Simiadae. The Simiadae then branched 
off into two great stems, the New World and Old 
World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote 
period, Man, the wonder and glory of the Universe, 
proceeded. 

Thus we have given to man a pedigree of prodigious 
length, but not, it may be said, of noble quality. The 
world, it has often been remarked, appears as if it had 
long been preparing for the advent of man : and this, 
in one sense is strictly true, for he owes his birth to a 
long line of progenitors. If any single link in this 
chain had never existed, man would not have been 
exactly what he now is. Unless we wilfully close our 
eyes, we may, with our present knowledge, approxi- 
mately recognise our parentage; nor need we feel 
ashamed of it. The most humble organism is some-

any living creature, however humble, without being

and properties.

It is not my intention here to describe the several

what is the value of the differences between them 
under a classificatory point of view, and how they 
have originated. In determining whether two or 
more allied forms ought to be ranked as species or 
varieties, naturalists are practically guided by the fol- 
lowing considerations ; namely, the amount o: differ- 
ence between them, and whether such differences relate 
to few or many points of structure, and whether they 
are of physiological importance ; but more especially 
whether they are constant. Constancy of character is 
what is chiefly valued and sought for by naturalists. 
Whenever it can be shewn, or rendered probable, that 
the forms in question have remained distinct for a

long period, this becomes an argument of much weight 
in favour of treating them as species. Even a slight 
degree of sterility between any two forms when first 
crossed, or in their ofi“spring, is generally considered 
^ as a decisive test of their specific distinctness ; and 
their continued persistence without blending within 
the same area, is usually accepted as sufficient evi- 
dence, either of some degree of mutual sterility, or 
in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to 
pairing. 

Independently of fusion from intercrossing, the 
complete absence, in a well-investigated region, of 
varieties linking together any two closely-allied forms, 
is probably the most important of all the criterions of 
their specific distinctness ; and this is a somewhat 
different consideration from mere constancy of 
character, for two forms may be highly variable and 
yet not yield intermediate varieties. G-eographical 
distribution is often brought into play unconsciously 
and sometimes consciously ; so that forms living in 
two widely separated areas, in which most of the 
other inhabitants are specifically distinct, are them- 
selves usually looked at as distinct ; but in truth this 
affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races 
from so-called good or true species. 

Now let us apply these generally-admitted principles 
to the races of man, viewing him in the same spirit as 
a naturalist would any other animal. In regard to 
the amount of difference between the races, we must 
make some allowance for our nice powers of discrimi- 
nation gained by the long habit of observing ourselves. 
In India, as Elphinstone remarks, although a newly- 
arrived European cannot at first distinguish the

various native races, yet they soon appear to him 
extremely dissimilar ; ^ and the Hindoo cannot at first 
perceive any difference between the several European 
nations. Even the most distinct races of man are 
much more like each other in form than would at first 
be supposed ; certain negro tribes must be excepted, 
whilst others, as Dr. Eohlfs writes to me, and as I 
have myself seen, have Caucasian features. This 
general similarity is well shewn by the French photo- 
graphs in the Collection Anthropologique du Museum 
de Paris of the men belonging to various races, the 
greater number of which might pass for Europeans, 
as many persons to whom I have shewn them have 
remarked. Nevertheless, these men, if seen alive, 
would undoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we 
are clearly much influenced in our judgment by the 
mere colour of the skin and hair, by slight differences 
in the features, and by expression. 

There is, however, no doubt that the various races, 
when carefully compared and measured, differ much 
from each other, — as in the texture of the hair, the 
relative proportions of all parts of the body,^ the 
capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the 
skull, and even in the convolutions of the brain.^ But 
it would be an endless task to specify the numerous

points of difference. The races differ also in constitu- 
tion, in acclimatisation and in liability to certain 
diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise 
very distinct ; chiefly as it would appear in their 
emotional, bxit partly in their intellectual faculties. 
Every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, 
must have been struck with the contrast between the 
taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and 
the light-hearted, talkative negroes. There is a nearly 
similar contrast between the Malays and the Papuans,^ 
who live under the same physical conditions, and are 
separated from each other only by a narrow space of 
sea. 

We will first consider the arguments which may be 
advanced in favour of classing the races of man as 
distinct species, and then the arguments on the other 
side. If a naturalist, who had never before seen a 
Negro, Hottentot, Australian, or Mongolian, were to 
compare them, he would at once perceive that they 
differed in a multitude of characters, some of slight 
and some of considerable importance. On enquiry he 
would find that they were adapted to live under widely 
difierent climates, and that they difiered somewhat in 
bodily constitution and mental disposition. If he 
were then told that hundreds of similar specimens 
could be brought from the same countries, he would 
assuredly declare that they were as good species as 
many to which he had been in the habit of affixing 
specific names. This conclusion would be greatly 
strengthened as soon as he had ascertained that these 
forms had all retained the same character for many 
centuries ; and that negroes, apparently identical with 
* Wallace, ‘ The Malay Archipelago,’ voL ii. 1869, p. 178.

existing negroes, had lived at least 4000 years ago.® 
He would also hear, on the authority of an excellent 
observer. Dr. Lund,® that the human skulls found in 
the caves of Brazil, entombed with' many extinct 
mammals, belonged to the same type as that now 
prevailing throughout the American Continent. 

Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geogra- 
phical distribution, and he would probably declare 
that those forms must be distinct species, which differ 
not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as 
damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions. He 
might appeal to the fact that no species in the group 
next to man— namely, the Quadrumana, can resist a 
low temperature, or any considerable change of climate; 
and that the species which come nearest to man have 
never been reared to maturity, even under the tem- 
perate climate of Europe. He would be deeply im- 


® With resi^ect to the figures 
in the famous Egyptian caves

from finding recognisable repre- 
sentations of the dozen or more 
nations which some authors be- 
lieve that they can recognise. 
Even some of the most strongly- 
marked races cannot be identi- 
fied with that degree of una- 
nimity which might have been 
expected from what has been 
written on the subject. Thus 
Messrs. Nott and Gliddon

distinctness of the races of man

speaking of young Meranon (the 
same as Rameses II., as I am 
informed by Mr. Birch), insists 
in the strongest manner that he 
is identical in character with the 
Jews of Antwerp. Again, when 
I looked at the statue of Amu- 
noph III., I agreed with two 
officers of the establishment, 
both competent judges, that he 
had a strongly-marked negro 
type of features; but Messrs. 
Nott and Gliddon (ibid. p. 146,

brid, but not of “ negro inter- 
mixture.”

pressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz,’’ that 
the different races of man are distributed over the 
world in the same zoological provinces, as those in- 
habited by undoubtedly distinct species and genera of 
mammals. This is manifestly the case with the 
Australian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man ; in a 
less well-marked manner with the Hottentots; but 
plainly with the Papuans and Malays, who are sepa- 
rated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by nearly the same 
line which divides the great Malayan and Australian 
zoological provinces. The Aborigines of America range 
throughout the Continent; and this at first appears 
opposed to the above rule, for most of the productions 
of the Southern and Northern halves differ widely : yet 
some few living forms, as the opossum, range from the 
one into the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic 
Edentata. The Esquimaux, like other Arctic animals, 
extend round the whole polar regions. It should be 
observed that the amount of difference between the 
mammals of the several zoological provinces does not 
correspond with the degree of separation between the 
latter ; so that it can hardly be considered as an 
anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the American 
much less from the other races of man, than do the 
mammals of the African and American continents from 
the mammals of the other provinces. Man, it may be 
added, does not appear to have aboriginally inhabited 
any oceanic island ; and in this respect, he resembles 
the other members of his class.

the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as

such, or as specifically distinct, that is, whether any of 
them are descended from distinct wild species, every 
naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their 
external parasites being specifically distinct. All the 
more stress would he laid on this fact, as it would be 
an exceptional one ; for I am informed by Mr. Denny 
that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and 
pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species 
of Pediculi or lice. Now Mr. A. Murray has carefully 
examined the Pediculi collected in different countries 
from the different races of man ; ® and he finds that 
they differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of 
their claws and limbs. In every case in which many 
specimens were obtained the differences were constant. 
The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured 
me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich 
Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies 
of the English sailors, they died in the course of three 
or four days. These Pediculi were darker coloured, 
and appeared different from those proper to the natives 
of Chiloe in South America, of which he gave me 
specimens. These, again, appeared larger and much 
softer than European lice. Mr. Murray procured four 
kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the 
Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and 
Kaffirs ; two kinds from the natives of Australia ; two 
from North and two from South America. In these 
latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came 
from natives inhabiting different districts. With 
insects slight structural differences, if constant, are 
generally esteemed of specific value : and the fact of 
the races of man being infested by parasites, which

THE DESCENT OP MAN. 


Part I. 


appear to be specifically distinct, might fairly be 
urged as an argument that the races themselves ought 
to be classed as distinct species. 

Our supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far 
in his investigation, would next enquire whether the 
races of men, when crossed, were in any degree sterile. 
He might consult the work^ of Professor Broca, a 
cautious and philosophical observer, and in this he 
would find good evidence that some races were quite 
fertile together, but evidence of an opposite nature in 
regard to other races. Thus it has been asserted that 
the native women of Australia and Tasmania rarely 
produce children to European men; the evidence, 
however, on this head has now been shewn to be 
almost valueless. The half-castes are killed by the 
pure blacks : and an account has lately been published 
of eleven half-caste youths murdered and burnt at the 
same time, whose remains were found by the police.^® 
Again, it has often been said that when mulattoes 
intermarry, they produce few children ; on the other 
hand, Dr. Bachman, of Charleston,^ positively asserts 
that he has known mulatto families which have inter- 
married for several generations, and have continued on 
an average as fertile as either pure whites or pure 
blacks. Enquiries formerly made by Sir C. Lyell on

trzelecki’s statement that Aus- 
tralian women who have borne 
children to a white man, are 
afterwards sterile with their own 


race, is disproved. M. A. de 
Quatrefages has also collected 
(‘ Revue des Cours Scientifiques,’ 
March, 1869, p. 239), much 
evidence that Australians and 
Europeans are not sterile when 
crossed.

this subject led him, as he informs me, to the same 
conclusion.^^ In the United States the census for the 
year 1854 included, according to Dr. Bachman, 405,751 
mulattoes; and this number, considering all the cir- 
cumstances of the case, seems small ; but it may partly 
be accounted for by the degraded and anomalous 
position of the class, and by the profligacy of the 
women. A certain amount of absorption of mulattoes 
into negroes must always be in progress; and this 
would lead to an apparent diminution of the former. 
The inferior vitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a 
trustworthy work^^ as a well-known phenomenon ; and 
this, although a dififerent consideration from their 
lessened fertility, may perhaps be advanced as a proof 
of the specific distinctness of the parent races. No 
doubt both animal and vegetable hybrids, when pro- 
duced from extremely distinct species, are liable to 
premature death ; but the parents of mulattoes cannot 
be put under the category of extremely distinct species. 
The common Mule, so notorious for long life and 
vigour, and yet so sterile, shews how little necessary 
connection there is in hybrids between lessened 
fertility and vitality ; other analogous cases could be 
cited. 


“ Dr. Rohlfs writes to me 
that he found the mixed races 
in the Great Sahara, derived 
from Arabs, Berbers, and Ne- 
groes of tiiree tribes, extraordi- 
narily fertile. On the other 
hand, Mr. Winwood Reade in- 
forms me that the Negroes on 
the Gold Coast, though ^miring 
white men and mulattoes, have 
a maxim that mulattoes should 
not intermarry, as the children 


are few and sickly. This belief, 
as Mr. Reade remarks, deserves 
attention, as white men have 
visited and resided on the Gold 
Coast for four hundred years, so 
that the natives have had ample 
time to gain knowledge through 
3xprience.

Even if it should hereafter be proved that all- the 
races of men were perfectly fertile together, he who 
was inclined from other reasons to rank them as 
distinct species, might with justice argue that fertility 
and sterility are not safe criterions of specific distinct- 
ness. We know that these qualities are easily aflfected 
by changed conditions of life, or by close inter-breeding, 
and that they are governed by highly complex laws, 
for instance, that of the unequal fertility of converse 
crosses between the same two species. With forms 
which must be ranked as undoubted species, a perfect 
series exists from those which are absolutely sterile 
when crossed, to those which are almost or completely 
fertile. The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly 
with the degrees of difference between the parents in 
external structure or habits of life. Man in many 
respects may be compared with those animals which 
have long been domesticated, and a large body of 
evidence can be advanced in favour of the Pallasian. 
doctrine,^'^ that domestication tends to eliminate the 


‘ The Variation of Animals 
and Plants under Domestication,’ 
vol. ii. p. 109. I may here 
remind the reader that the ste- 
rility of species when crossed is 
not a specially-acquired quality, 
but, like the incapacity of certain 
trees to be grafted together, is 
incidental on other acquired 
differences. The nature of these 
differences is unknown, but they 
relate more especially to the re- 
productive system, and much 
less so to external structure or 
to ordinary differences in con- 
stitution. One important ele- 
ment in the sterility of crossed 
species apparently lies in one or 


both having been long habitu- 
ated to fixed conditions ; for we 
know that changed conditions 
have a special influence on the 
reproductive system, and we 
have good reason to believe (as 
before remarked) that the fluc- 
tuating conditions of domestica- 
tion tend to eliminate that ste- 
rility which is so general with 
species, in a natural state, when 
crossed. It has elsewhere been 
shewn by me (ibid. vol. ii. p. 
185, and ‘ Origin of Species,’ 5th 
edit. p. 317), that the sterility 
of crossed species has not been 
acquired through natural selec- 
tion : we can see that when two

sterility which is so general a result of the crossing of 
species in a state of nature. From these several con- 
siderations, it may be justly urged that the perfect 
fertility of the intercrossed races of man, if established, 
would not absolutely preclude us from ranking them 
as distinct species. 

Independently of fertility, the characters presented 
by the offspring from a cross have been thought to 
indicate whether or not the parent-forms ought to be 
ranked as species or varieties; but after carefully 
studying the evidence, I have come to the conclusion 
that no general rules of this kind can he trusted. The 
ordinary result of a cross is the production of a blended 
or intermediate form ; but in certain cases some of the 
offspring take closely after one parent-form, and some 
after the other. This is especially apt to occur when 
the parents differ in characters which first appeared as 
sudden variations or monstrosities.^^ I refer to this 


forms have already been ren- 
dered very sterile, it is scarcely 
possible that their sterility 
should be augmented by the 
preservation or survival of the 
more and more sterile individ- 
uals ; for, as the sterility in- 
creases, fewer and fewer offspring 
will be produced from which to 
breed, and at last only single 
individuals will be produced at 
the rarest intervals. But there 
is even a higher grade of sterility 
than this. Both Gartner and 
Kolreuter have proved that in 
genera of plants, including many 
species, a series enn be formed 
from species which, when crossed, 
yield fewer and fewer seeds, to 
species which never produce a 


single seed, but yet are affected 
by the pollen of the other species, 
as shewn by the swelling of the 
germen. It is here manifestly 
impossible to select the more 
sterile individuals, which have 
already ceased to yield seeds ; so 
that the acme of sterility, when 
the germen alone is affected, 
cannot have been gained through 
selection. This acme, and no 
doubt the other grades of ste- 
rility, are the incidental results 
of certain unknown ditferences 
in the constitution of the repro- 
ductive system of the species 
which are crossed.

point, because Dr. Kohlfs informs me that he has 
frequently seen in Africa the offspring of negroes 
crossed with members of other races, either completely 
black or completely white, or rarely piebald. On the 
other hand, it is notorious that in America mulattoes 
commonly present an intermediate appearance. 

We have now seen that a naturalist might feel him- 
self fully justified in ranking the races of man as 
distinct species ; for he has found that they are 
distinguished by many differences in structure and 
constitution, some being of importance. These differ- 
ences have, also, remained nearly constant for very 
long periods of time. Our naturalist will have been 
in some degree influenced by the enormous range of 
man, which is a great anomaly in the class of mammals, 
if mankind be viewed as a single species. He will 
have been struck with the distribution of the several 
so-called races, which accords with that of other un- 
doubtedly distinct species of mammals. Finally, 
he might urge that the mutual fertility of all the 
races has not as yet been fully proved, and even if 
proved would not be an absolute proof of their specific 
identity. 

On the other side of the question, if our supposed 
naturalist were to enquire whether the forms of man 
keep distinct like ordinary species, when mingled 
together in large numbers in the same country, he 
would immediately discover that this was by no means 
the case. In Brazil he would behold an immense 
mongrel population of Negroes and Portuguese; in 
Chiloe, and other parts of South America, he would 
behold the whole population consisting of Indians and 


Chap. VII. 


THE RACES OF MAN. 


269 


Spaniards blended in various degrees.^® In many parts 
of the same continent he would meet with the most 
complex crosses between Negroes, Indians, and Euro- 
peans ; and judging from the vegetable kingdom, such 
triple crosses afford the severest test of the mutual 
fertility of the parent forms. In one island of the 
Pacific he would find a small population of mingled 
Polynesian and English blood ; and in the Fiji Archi- 
pelago a population of Polynesian and Negritos crossed 
in all degrees. Many analogous cases could be added; 
for instance, in Africa. Hence the races of man are 
not suflficiently distinct to inhabit the same country 
without fusion ; and the absence of fusion affords the 
usual and best test of specific distinctness. 

Our naturalist would likewise be much disturbed as 
soon as he perceived that the distinctive characters of 
all the races were highly variable. This fact strikes 
every one on first beholding the negro slaves in Brazil, 
who have been imported from all parts of Africa. The 
same remark holds good with the Polynesians, and with 
many other races. It may be doubted whether any 
character can be named which is distinctive of a race 
and is constant. Savages, even within the limits of 
the same tribe, are not nearly so uniform in character, 
as has been often asserted. Hottentot women offer 
certain peculiarities, more strongly marked than those 
occurring in any other race, but these are known not to 
be of constant occurrence. In the several American 
tribes, colour and hairiness differ considerably ; as does 

M. de Quatrefages has given are a much crossed race of Por- 
(‘ Anthropolog. Review,’ Jan. tuguese and Indians, with a 
1869, p. 22), an interesting ac- mixture of the blood of other

colour to a certain degree, and the shape of the features 
greatly, in the Negroes of Africa. The shape of the 
skull varies much in some races and so it is with 
every other character. Now all naturalists have learnt 
by dearly bought experience, how rash it is to attempt 
to define species by the aid of inconstant characters. 

But the most weighty of all the arguments against 
treating the races of man as distinct species, is that 
they graduate into each other, independently in many 
cases, as far as we can judge, of their having inter- 
crossed. Man has been studied more carefully than 
any other animal, and yet there is the greatest possible 
diversity amongst capable judges whether he should be 
classed as a single species or race, or as two (Virey), as 
three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenhach), 
six (Bufibn), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven 
(Pickering), fifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Des- 
moulins), twenty-two (Morton), sixty (Crawfurd), or as 
sixty-three, according to Burke.^® This diversity of 
judgment does not prove that the races ought not to 
be ranked as species, but it shews that they graduate 
into each other, and that it is hardly possible to dis- 
cover clear distinctive characters between them. 

Every naturalist who has had the misfortune to 
undertake the description of a group of highly varying 
organisms, has encountered cases (I speak after expe-

rience) precisely like that of man ; and if of a cautious 
disposition, he will end by uniting all the forms which 
graduate into each other, under a single species ; for 
he will say to himself that he has no right to give 
names to objects which he cannot define. Cases of this 
kind occur in the Order which includes man, namely in 
certain genera of monkeys ; whilst in other genera, as 
in Cercopithecus, most of the species can be determined 
with certainty. In the American genus Cebus, the 
various forms are ranked by some naturalists as species, 
by others as mere geographical races. Now if numer- 
ous specimens of Cebus were collected from all parts 
of South America, and those forms which at present 
appear to be specifically distinct, were found to graduate 
into each other by close steps, they would usually be 
ranked as mere varieties or races ; and this course has 
been followed by most naturalists with respect to the 
races of man. Nevertheless, it must be confessed that 
there are forms, at least in the vegetable kingdom,^® 
which we cannot avoid naming as species, but which 
are connected together by numberless gradations, in- 
dependently of intercrossing. 

Some naturalists have lately employed the term 
“ sub-species ” to designate forms which possess many 
of the characteristics of true species, but which hardly 
deserve so high a rank. Now if we reflect on the 
weighty arguments above given, for raising the races 
of man to the dignity of species, and the insuperable 
difficulties on the other side in defining them, it seems 
that the term “ sub-species ” might here be used with

propriety. But from long habit the term “ race ” will 
perhaps always be employed. The choice of terms is 
only so far important in that it is desirable to use, as 
far as possible, the same terms for the same degrees 
of difference. Unfortunately this can rarely be done : 
for the larger genera generally include closely-allied 
forms, which can be distinguished only with much 
difficulty, whilst the smaller genera within the same 
family include forms that are perfectly distinct; yet 
all must be ranked equally as species. So again, species 
within the same large genus by no means resemble 
each other to the same degree : on the contrary, some 
of them can generally be arranged in little groups 
round other species, like satellites round planets.^® 

The question whether mankind consists of one or 
several species has of late years been much discussed 
by anthropologists, who are divided into the two schools 
of monogenists and polygenists. Those who do not 
admit the principle of evolution, must look at species 
as separate creations, or as in some manner as distinct 
entities ; and they must decide what forms of man they 
will consider as species by the analogy of the method 
commonly pursued in ranking other organic beings as 
species. But it is a hopeless endeavour to decide this 
point, until some definition of the term ‘‘ species ” is 
generally accepted ; and the definition must not include 
an indeterminate element such as an act of creation. 
We might as well attempt without any definition to 
decide whether a certain number of houses should be 
called a village, town, or city. We have a practical 
illustration of the difficulty in the never-ending doubts 

‘ Origin of Species,’ 5th edit. p. 68. 


CUAP. VII. 


THE KACES OF MAN. 


278 


whether many closely-allied mammals, birds, insects', 
and plants, which represent each other respectively in 
North America and Europe, should be ranked as species 
or geographical races ; and the like holds true of the 
productions of many islands situated at some little 
distance from the nearest continent. 

Those naturalists, on the other hand, who admit the 
principle of evolution, and this is now admitted by the 
majority of rising men, will feel no doubt that all the 
races of man are descended from a single primitive stock ; 
whether or not they may think fit to designate the races 
as distinct species, for the sake of expressing their 
amount of diflference.^^ With our domestic animals 
the question whether the various races have arisen 
from one or more species is somewhat different. Al- 
though it may be admitted that all the races, as well 
as all the natural species within the same genus, have 
sprung from the same primitive stock, yet it is a fit 
subject for discussion, whether all the domestic races 
of the dog, for instance, have acquired their present 
amount of difference since some one species was first 
domesticated by man ; or whether they owe some of 
their characters to inheritance from distinct species, 
which had already been differentiated in a state of 
nature. With man no such question can arise, for he 
cannot be said to have been domesticated at any par- 
ticular period. 

During an early stage in the divergence of the races 
of man from a common stock, the differences between 
the races and their number must have been small ; 
consequently as far as their distinguishing characters

"are concerned, they then had less claim to rank as 
distinct species than the existing so-called races. 
Nevertheless, so arbitrary is the term of species, that 
such early races would perhaps have been ranked by 
some naturalists as distinct species, if their differences, 
although extremely slight, had been more constant 
than they are at present, and had not graduated into 
each other. 

It is however possible, though far from probable, 
that the early progenitors of man might formerly have 
diverged much in character, until they became more 
unlike each other than any now existing races; but 
that subsequently, as suggested by Vogt,^^ they con- 
verged in character. When man selects the offspring 
of two distinct species for the same object, he some- 
times induces a considerable amount of convergence, 
as far as general appearance is concerned. This is the 
case, as shown by Von Nathusius,^^ with the improved 
breeds of the pig, which are descended from two 
distinct species ; and in a less marked manner with 
the improved breeds of cattle. A great anatomist, 
Gratiolet, maintains that the anthropomorphous apes 
do not form a natural sub-group ; but that the orang 
is a highly developed gibbon or semnopithecus, the 
chimpanzee a highly developed macacus, and the 
gorilla a highly developed mandrill. If this con- 
clusion, which rests almost exclusively on brain- 
characters, be admitted, we should have a case of 
convergence at least in external characters, for the

anthropomorphous apes are certainly more like each 
other in many points, than they are to other apes. 
All analogical resemblances, as of a whale to a fish, 
may indeed be said to be cases of convergence ; but 
this term has never been applied to superficial and 
adaptive resemblances. It would, however, be ex- 
tremely rash to attribute to convergence close simi- 
larity of character in many points of structure 
amongst the modified descendants of widely distinct 
beings. The form of a crystal is determined solely by 
the molecular forces, and it is not surprising that 
dissimilar substances should sometimes assume the 
same form ; but with organic beings we should bear in 
mind that the form of each depends on an infinity of 
complex relations, namely on variations, due to causes 
far too intricate to be followed, — on the nature of the 
variations preserved, these depending on the physical 
conditions, and still more on the surrounding or- 
ganisms which compete with each, — and lastly, on 
inheritance (in itself a fluctuating element) from 
innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their 
forms determined through equally complex relations. 
It appears incredible that the modified descendants of 
two organisms, if these differed from each other in a 
marked manner, should ever afterwards converge so 
closely as to lead to a near approach to identity 
throughout their whole organisation. In the case of 
the convergent races of pigs above referred to, evi- 
dence of their descent from two primitive stocks is, 
according to Von Nathusius, still plainly retained, in 
certain bones of their skulls. If the races of man had 
descended, as is supposed by some naturalists, from 
two or more species, which differed from each other as

much, or nearly as much, as does the orang from the 
gorilla, it can hardly he doubted that marked differ- 
ences in the structure of certain bones would still be 
discoverable in man as he now exists. 

Although the existing races of man differ in many 
respects, as in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions 
of the body, &c., yet if their whole structure be taken 
into consideration they are found to resemble each 
other closely in a multitude of points. Many of these 
are of so unimportant or of so singular a nature, that 
it is extremely improbable that they should have been 
independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species 
or races. The same remark holds good with equal or 
greater force with respect to the numerous points of 
mental similarity between the most distinct races of 
man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Euro- 
peans are as different from each other in mind as any 
three races that can be named ; yet I was incessantly 
struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the 
“ Beagle,” with the many little traits of character, 
shewing how similar their minds were to ours ; and so 
it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I hap- 
pened once to be intimate. 

He who will read Mr. Tylor’s and Sir J. Lubbock’s 
interesting works^"^ can hardly fail to be deeply im- 
pressed with the close similarity between the men of 
all races in tastes, dispositions and habits. This is 
shewn by the pleasure which they all take in dancing, 
rude music, acting, painting, tattooing, and otherwise

decorating themselves ; in their mutual comprehension 
of gesture-language, by the same expression in their 
features, and by the same inarticulate cries, when 
excited by the same emotions. This similarity, or 
rather identity, is striking, when contrasted with the 
different expressions and cries made by distinct species 
of monkeys. There is good evidence that the art of 
shooting with bows and arrows has not been handed 
down from any common progenitor of mankind, yet as 
Westropp and Nilsson have remarked,^^ the stone 
arrow-heads, brought from the most distant parts of 
the world, and manufactured at the most remote 
periods, are almost identical ; and this fact can only 
be accounted for by the various races having similar 
inventive or mental powers. The same observation 
has been made by archaeologists^® with respect to 
certain widely-prevalent ornaments, such as zig-zags, 
&c. ; and with respect to various simple beliefs and 
customs, such as the burying of the dead under 
megalithic structures. I remember observing in South 
America,^’ that there, as in so many other parts of 
the world, men have generally chosen the summits 
of lofty hills, to throw up piles of stones, either as a 
record of some remarkable event, or for burying their 
dead. 

Now when naturalists observe a close agreement in 
numerous small details of habits, tastes, and dis- 
positions between two or more domestic races, or

between nearly-allied natural forms, they use this 
fact as an argument that they are descended from a 
common progenitor who was thus endowed ; and con- 
sequently that all should be classed under the same 
species. The same argument may be applied with 
much force to the races of man. 

As it is improbable that the numerous and un- 
important points of resemblance between the several 
races of man in bodily structure and mental faculties 
(I do not here refer to similar customs) should all have 
been independently acquired, they must have been 
inherited from progenitors who had these same cha- 
racters. We thus gain some insight into the early 
state of man, before he had spread step by step over 
the face of the earth. The spreading of man to 
regions widely separated by the sea, no doubt, pre- 
ceded any great amount of divergence of character in 
the several races ; for otherwise we should sometimes 
meet with the same race in distinct continents ; and 
this is never the case. Sir J. Lubbock, after com- 
paring the arts now practised by savages in all parts 
of the world, specifies those which man could not have 
known, when he first wandered from his original birth- 
place ; for if once learnt they would never have been 
forgotten.^® He thus shews that ‘‘ the spear, which is 
but a development of the knife-point, and the club, 
which is but a long hammer, are the only things left.” 
He admits, however, that the art of making fire pro- 
bably had been already discovered, for it is common 
to all the races now existing, and was known to the 
ancient cave-inhabitants of Europe. Perhaps the art 
of making rude canoes or rafts was likewise known ; 

“ ‘ Prehistoric Times,’ 1869, p, 674. 


Chap. VII. 


THE RACES OF MAN. 


279 


but as man existed at a remote epoch, when the land 
in many places stood at a very different level to what 
it does now, he would have been able, without the aid 
of canoes, to have spread widely. Sir J. Lubbock 
further remarks how improbable it is that our earliest 
ancestors could have “ counted as high as ten, con- 
“ sidering that so many races now in existence cannot 
“ get beyond four.” Nevertheless, at this early period, 
the intellectual and social faculties of man could 
hardly have been inferior in any extreme degree to 
those possessed at present by the lowest savages; 
otherwise primeval man could not have been so 
eminently successful in the struggle for life, as proved 
by his early and wide diffusion. 

From the fundamental differences between certain 
languages, some philologists have inferred that when 
man first became widely diffused, he was not a 
speaking animal ; but it may be suspected that lan- 
guages, far less perfect than any now spoken, aided by 
gestures, might have been used, and yet have left 
no traces on subsequent and more highly-developed 
tongues. Without the use of some language, however 
imperfect, it appears doubtful whether man’s intel- 
lect could have risen to the standard implied by his 
dominant position at an early period. 

Whether primeval man, when he possessed but few 
arts, and those of the rudest kind, and when his power 
of language was extremely imperfect, would have 
deserved to be called man, must depend on the 
definition which we employ. In a series of forms 
graduating insensibly from some ape-like creature to 
man as he now exists, it would be impossible to fix on 
any definite point when the term “ man ” ought to be 


280 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part L 


used. But this is a matter of very little importance. 
So again, it is almost a matter of indiJfference whether 
the so-called races of man are thus designated, or are 
ranked as species or sub-species ; but the latter term 
appears the more appropriate. Finally, we may con- 
clude that when the principle of evolution is generally 
accepted, as it surely will be before long, the dispute 
between the monogenists and the polygenists will die 
a silent and unobserved death. 

One other question ought not to be passed over 
without notice, namely, whether, as is sometimes 
assumed, each sub-species or race of man has sprung 
from a single pair of progenitors. With our domestic 
animals a new race can readily be formed by carefully 
matching the varying offspring from a single pair, or 
even from a single individual possessing some new 
charactei ; but most of our races have been formed, 
not intentionally from a selected pair, but un- 
consciously by the preservation of many individuals 
which have varied, however slightly, in some useful or 
desired manner. If in one country stronger and 
heavier horses, and in another country lighter and 
fleeter ones, were habitually preferred, we may feel 
sure that two distinct sub-breeds would be produced in 
the course of time, without any one pair having been 
separated and bred from, in either country. Many 
races have been thus formed, and their manner of 
formation is closely analogous to that of natural 
species. We know, also, that the horses taken to the 
Falkland Islands have, during successive generations, 
become smaller and weaker, whilst those which have 
run wild on the Pampas have acquired larger and 


Chap. VII. 


THE EXTINCTION OF RACES. 


281 


coarser heads ; and such changes are manifestly due, 
not to any one pair, but to all the individuals having 
been subjected to the same conditions, aided, perhaps, 
by the principle of reversion. The new sub-breeds in 
such cases are not descended from any single pair, but 
from many individuals which have varied in different 
degrees, but in the same general manner ; and we may 
conclude that the races of man have been similarly 
produced, the modidcations being either the direct 
result of exposure to different conditions, or the 
indirect result of some form of selection. But to this 
latter subject we shall presently return. 

On the Extinction of the Races of Man . — The partial 
or complete extinction of many races and sub-races of 
man is historically known. Humboldt saw in South 
America a parrot which was the sole living creature 
that could speak a word of the language of a lost tribe. 
Ancient monuments and stone implements found in all 
parts of the world, about which no tradition has been 
preserved by the present inhabitants, indicate much 
extinction. Some small and broken tribes, remnants 
of former races, still survive in isolated and generally 
mountainous districts. In Europe the ancient races 
were all, according to Schaaffhausen,^® “ lower in the 
“ scale than the rudest living savages ; ” they must 
therefore have differed, to a certain extent, from any 
existing race. The remains described by Professor 
Broca from Les Eyzies, though they unfortunately 
appear to have belonged to a single family, indicate 
a race with a most singular combination of low 
or simious, and of high characteristics. This race

is “ entirely different from any other, ancient or 
“modern, that we have heard of.”^° It differed, 
therefore, from the quaternary race of the caverns of 
Belgium. 

Man can long resist conditions which appear ex- 
tremely unfavourable for his existence.®^ .He has long 
lived in the extreme regions of the North, with no 
wood for his canoes or implements, and with only 
blubber as fuel, and melted snow as drink. In the 
southern extremity of America the Fuegians survive 
without the protection of clothes, or of any building 
worthy to be called a hovel. In South Africa the 
aborigines wander over arid plains, where dangerous 
beasts abound. Man can withstand the deadly influence 
of the Terai at the foot of the Himalaya, and the 
pestilential shores of tropical Africa. 

Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of 
tribe with tribe, and race with race. Various checks 
are always in action, serving to keep down the numbers 
of each savage tribe, — such as periodical famines, 
nomadic habits and the consequent deaths of infants, 
prolonged suckling, wars, accidents, sickness, licentious- 
ness, the stealing of women, infanticide, and especially 
lessened fertility. If any one of these checks increases 
in power, even slightly, the tribe thus affected tends 
to decrease ; and when of two adjoining tribes one 
becomes less numerous and less powerful than the 
other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, 
cannibalism, slavery, and absorption. Even when a 
weaker tribe is not thus abruptly swept away, if it

once begins to decrease, it generally goes on decreasing 
until it becomes extinct.®^ 

When civilised nations come into contact with bar- 
barians the struggle is short, except where a deadly 
climate gives its aid to the native race. Of the causes 
which lead to the victory of civilised nations, some are 
plain and simple, others complex and obscure. We 
can see that the cultivation of the land will be fatal in 
many ways to savages, for they cannot, or will not, 
change their habits. New diseases and vices have in 
some cases proved highly destructive ; and it appears 
that a new disease often causes much death, until those 
who are most susceptible to its destructive influence 
are gradually weeded out ; and so it may be with 
the evil efi’ects from spirituous liquors, as well as with 
the unconquerably strong taste for them shewn by so 
many savages. It further appears, mysterious as is 
the fact, that the first meeting of distinct and separated 
people generates disease.^* Mr. Sproat, who in Van- 
couver Island closely attended to the subject of extinc- 
tion, believed that changed habits of life, consequent 
on the advent of Europeans, induces much ill health. 
He lays, also, great stress on the apparently trifling 
cause that the natives become “ bewildered and dull 
“ by the new life around them ; they lose the motives 
“ for exertion, and get no new ones in their place.”

ment.

The grade of their civilisation seems to he a most 
important element in the success of competing nations. 
A few centuries ago Europe feared the inroads of 
^Eastern barbarians; now any such fear would be 
ridiculous. It is a more curious fact, as Mr. Bagehot 
has remarked, that savages did not formerly waste 
away before the classical nations, as they now do before 
modern civilised nations ; had they done so, the old 
moralists would have mused over the event ; but there 
is no lament in any writer of that period over the 
perishing barbarians.^® The most potent of all the 
causes of extinction, appears in many cases to be 
lessened fertility and ill-health, especially amongst the 
children, arising from changed conditions of life, not- 
withstanding that the new conditions may not be in- 
jurious in themselves. I am much indebted to Mr. H. 
H. Howorth for having called my attention to this 
subject, and for having given me information respect- 
ing it. I have collected the following cases. 

When Tasmania was first colonised the natives were 
roughly estimated by some at 7000 and by others at 
20,000. Their number was soon greatly reduced, 
chiefly by fighting with the English and with each 
other. After the famous hunt by all the colonists, 
when the remaining natives delivered themselves up to 
the government, they consisted only of 120 individuals,®^ 
who were in 1832 transported to Flinders Island. 
This island, situated between Tasmania and Australia, 
is forty miles long, and from twelve to eighteen miles

broad : it seems healthy, and the natives were well 
treated. Nevertheless, they suffered greatly in health. 
In 1834 they consisted (Bonwick, p. 250) of forty-seven 
adult males, forty-eight adult females, and sixteen 
children, or in all of 111 souls. In 1835 only one 
hundred were left. As they continued rapidly to de- 
crease, and as they themselves thought that they 
should not perish so quickly elsewhere, they were 
removed in 1847 to Oyster Cove in the southern part 
of Tasmania. They then consisted (Dec. 20th, 1847) 
of fourteen men, twenty-two women and ten children.^® 
But the change of site did no good. Disease and death 
still pursued them, and in 1864 one man (who died in 
1869), and three elderly women alone survived. The 
infertility of the women is even a more remarkable 
fact than the liability of all to ill-health and death. 
At the time when only nine women were left at Oyster 
Cove, they told Mr. Bonwick (p. 386), that only two 
had ever borne children : and these two had together 
produced only three children ! 

With respect to the cause of this extraordinary state 
of things, Dr. Story remarks that death followed the 
attempts to civilise the natives. “ If left to themselves 
“to roam as they were wont and undisturbed, they 
“ would have reared more children, and there would 
“ have been less mortality.” Another careful observer 
of the natives, Mr. Davis, remarks, “ The births have 
“ been few and the deaths numerous. This may have 
“ been in a great measure owing to their change of 
“ living and food ; but more so to their banishment 
“ from the mainland of Van Diemen’s Land, and con-

“ sequent depression of spirits ” (Bonwick, pp. 388, 
390). 

Similar facts have been observed in two widely 
different parts of Australia. The celebrated explorer, 
' Mr. Gregory, told Mr. Bonwick, that in Queensland 
“ the want of reproduction was being already felt with 
‘‘ the blacks, even in the most recently settled parts, 
‘‘ and that decay would set in.” Of thirteen aborigines 
from Shark’s Bay who visited Murchison Eiver, twelve 
died of consumption within three months.^® 

The decrease of the Maories of New Zealand has been 
carefully investigated by Mr. Fenton, in an admirable 
Keport, from which all the following statements, with 
one exception, are taken.'^® The decrease in number 
since 1830 is admitted by every one, including the 
natives themselves, and is still steadily progressing. 
Although it has hitherto been found impossible to take 
an actual census of the natives, their numbers were 
carefully estimated by residents in many districts. 
The result seems trustworthy, and shows that during 
the fourteen years, previous to 1858, the decrease was 
19*42 per cent. Some of the tribes, thus carefully 
examined, lived above a hundred miles apart, some on 
the coast, some inland ; and their means of subsistence 
and habits differed to a certain extent (p. 28). The 
total number in 1858 was believed to be 53,700, and 
in 1872, after a second interval of fourteen years, 
another census was taken, and the number is given 
as only 36,359, shewing a decrease of 32*29 per 
cent Mr. Fenton, after shewing in detail the

insufficiency of the various causes, usually assigned in 
explanation of this extraordinary decrease, such as 
new diseases, the profligacy of the women, drunkenness, 
wars, &c., concludes on weighty grounds that it de- 
pends chiefly on the unproductiveness of the women, 
and on the extraordinary mortality of the young 
children (pp. 31, 34). In proof of this he shews (p. 33) 
that in 1844 there was one non-adult for every 2*57 
adults ; whereas in 1858 there was only one non-adult 
for every 3*27 adults. The mortality of the adults is 
also great. He adduces as a further cause of the de- 
crease the inequality of the sexes ; for fewer females 
are born than males. To this latter point, depending 
perhaps on a widely distinct cause, I shall return in a 
future chapter. Mr. Fenton contrasts with astonish- 
ment the decrease in New Zealand with the increase in 
Ireland ; countries not very dissimilar in climate, and 
where the inhabitants now follow nearly similar habits. 
The Maories themselves (p. 35) attribute their de- 
“ cadence, in some measure, to the introduction of new 
“food and clothing, and the attendant change of 
“ habits ; ” and it will be seen, when we consider the 
influence of changed conditions on fertility, that they 
are probably right. The diminution began between 
the years 1830 and 1840 ; and Mr. Fenton shews 
(p. 40) that about 1830, the art of manufacturing 
putrid corn (maize), by long steeping in water, was 
discovered and largely practised ; and this proves that 
a change of habits was beginning amongst the natives, 
even when New Zealand was only thinly inhabited by 
Europeans. When I visited the Bay of Islands in 
1835, the dress and food of the inhabitants had already 
been much modified : they raised potatoes, maize, and

other agricultural produce, and exchanged them for 
English manufactured goods and tobacco. 

It is evident from many statements in the life of 
Bishop Patteson,^^ that the Melanesians of the New 
' Hebrides and neighbouring archipelagoes, suffered to 
an extraordinary degree in health, and perished in 
large numbers, when they were removed to New 
Zealand, Norfolk Island, and other salubrious places, 
in order to be educated as missionaries. 

The decrease of the native population of the Sand- 
wich Islands is as notorious as that of New Zealand. 
It has been roughly estimated by those best capable of 
judging, that when Cook discovered the Islands in 
1779, the population amounted to about 300,000. 
According to a loose census in 1823, the numbers then 
were 142,050. In 1832, and at several subsequent 
periods, an accurate census was officially taken, but I 
have been able to obtain only the following returns :

We here see that in the interval of forty years, 
between 1832 and 1872, the population has decreased 
no less than sixty-eight per cent. ! This has been 
attributed by most writers to the profligacy of the 
women, to former bloody wars, and to the severe 
labour imposed on conquered tribes and to newly 
introduced diseases, which have been on several 
occasions extremely destructive. No doubt these and 
other such causes have been highly eflScient, and may 
account for the extraordinary rate of decrease between 
the years 1832 and 1836 ; but the most potent of all 
the causes seems to be lessened fertility. According 
to Dr. Euschenberger of the U.S. Navy, who visited 
these islands between 1835 and 1837, in one district 
of Hawaii, only twenty-five men out of 1134, and in 
another district only ten out of 637, had a family with 
as many as three children. Of eighty married women, 
only thirty-nine had ever borne children ; and “ the 
“ official report gives an average of half a child to each 
“ married couple in the whole island.” This is almost 
exactly the same average as with the Tasmanians at 
Oyster Cove. Jarves, who published his History in 
1843, says that “ families who have three children are 
“ freed from all taxes ; those having more, are rewarded 
“ by gifts of land and other encouragements.” This 
unparalleled enactment by the government w^ell shews 
how infertile the race had become. The Eev. A. Bishop 
stated in the Hawaiian ‘ Spectator ’ in 1839, that a 
large proportion of the children die at early ages, and 
Bishop Staley informs me that this is still the case, 
just as in New Zealand. This has been attributed to 
the neglect of the children by the women, but it is 
probably in large part due to innate weakness of con-

stitution in the children, in relation to the lessened 
fertility of their parents. There is, moreover, a 
further resemblance to the case of New Zealand, in 
the fact that there is a large excess of male over 
female births: the census of .1872 gives 31,650 males 
to 25,247 females of all ages, that is 125*36 males for 
every 100 females ; whereas in all civilised countries 
the females exceed the males. No doubt the profligacy 
of the women may in part account for their small 
fertility ; hut their changed habits of life is a much 
more probable cause, and which will at the same time 
account for the increased mortality, especially of the 
children. The islands were visited by Cook in 1779, 
by Vancouver in 1794, and often subsequently by 
whalers. In 1819 missionaries arrived, and found that 
' idolatry bad been already abolished, and other changes 
effected by the king. After this period there was a 
rapid change in almost all the habits of life of the 
natives, and they soon became “ the most civilised of 
“ the Pacific Islanders.” One of my informants, 
Mr. Coan, who was born on the islands, remarks that 
the natives have undergone a greater change in their 
habits of life in the course of fifty years than English- 
men during a thousand years. From information 
received from Bishop Staley, it does not appear that 
the poorer classes have ever much changed their diet, 
although many new kinds of fruit have been intro- 
duced, and the sugar-cane is in universal use. Owing, 
however, to their passion for imitating Europeans, 
they altered their manner of dressing at an early 
period, and the use of alcoholic drinks became very 
general. Although these changes^ appear inconsider- 
able, I can w^ell believe, from what is known with 


Chap. VII.

respect to animals, that they might suffice to les.sen 
the fertility of the natives."*^ 

Lastly, Mr. Macnamara states that the low and 
degraded inhabitants of the Andaman Islands, on the 
eastern side of the Gulf of Bengal, are “ eminently 
“ susceptible to any change of climate : in fact, take 
“ them away from their island homes, and they are 
“ almost certain to die, and that independently of diet 
“ or extraneous influences.” He further states that 
the inhabitants of the Valley of Nepal, which is 
extremely hot in summer, and also the various hill- 
tribes of India, suffer from dysentery and fever when 
on the plains ; and they die if they attempt to pass 
the whole year there. 

We thus see that many of the wilder races of man 
are apt to suffer much in health when subjected to 
changed conditions or habits of life, and not exclusively 
from being transported to a new climate. Mere altera- 
tions in habits, which do not appear injurious • in 
themselves, seem to have this same effect ; and in 
several cases the children are particularly liable to 
suffer. It has often been said, as Mr. Macnamara 
remarks, that man can resist with impunity the 
greatest diversities of climate and other changes ; but 


The foregoing statements 
are taken chiefly from the fol- 
lowing works : ‘ Jarves’ History 
of the Hawaiian Islands,’ 1843, 
p. 400-407. Cheever, ‘Life in 
the Sandwich Islands,’ 1851, p.

manians,’ 1870, p. 378. Bishop 
is quoted by Sir E. Belcher, 
‘ Voyage Round the World,’ 
1843, vol. i. p. 272. I owe the 


census of the several years to 
the kindness of Mr. Coan, at the 
request of Dr. Youmans of New 
York ; and in most cases 1 have 
compared the Youmans figures 
with those given in several of 
the above-named works. I have 
omitted the census for 1850, as 
I have seen two widely different 
numbers given.

this is true only of the civilised races. Man in his 
wild condition seems to be in this respect almost as 
susceptible as his nearest allies, the anthropoid apes, 
which have never yet survived long, when removed 
from their native cmintry. 

Lessened fertility from changed conditions, as in 
the case of the Tasmanians, Maories, Sandwich 
Islanders, and apparently the Australians, is still 
more interesting than their liability to ill-health and 
death; for even a slight degree of infertility, com- 
bined with those other causes which tend to check the 
increase of every population, would sooner or later 
lead to extinction. The diminution of fertility may 
be explained in some cases by the profligacy of the 
women (as until lately with the Tahitians), but 
Mr. Fenton has shewn that this explanation by no 
means suffices with the New Zealanders, nor does it 
with the Tasmanians. 

In the paper above quoted, Mr. Macnamara gives 
reasons for believing that the inhabitants of districts 
subject to malaria are apt to be sterile; but this 
cannot apply in several of the above cases. Some 
writers have suggested that the aborigines of islands 
have suffered in fertility and health from long con- 
tinued inter-breeding ; but in the above cases infertility 
has coincided too closely with the arrival of Europeans 
for us to admit this explanation. Nor have we at 
present any reason to believe that man is highly 
sensitive to the evil effects of inter-breeding, especially 
in areas so large as New Zealand, and the Sandwich 
archipelago with its diversified stations. On the 
contrary, it is known that the present inhabitants of 
Norfolk Island are nearly all cousins or near relations, 


Chap. VH.

as are the Todas in India, and the inhabitants of some 
of the Western Islands of Scotland ; and yet they seem 
Qot to have suffered in fertility. 

A much more probable view is suggested by the 
analogy of the lower animals. The reproductive 
system can be shewn to be susceptible to an extraor- 
dinary degree (though why we know not) to changed 
conditions of life ; and this susceptibility leads both to 
beneficial and to evil results. A large collection of 
facts on this subject is given in chap, xviii. of vol. ii. 
of my ‘ Variation of Animals and Plants under Domes- 
tication,’ I can here give only the briefest abstract ; 
and every one interested in the subject may consult 
the above work. Very slight changes increase the 
health, vigour and fertility of most or all organic 
beings, whilst other changes are known to render a 
large number of animals sterile. One of the most 
familiar cases, is that of tamed elephants not breeding 
in India ; though they often breed in Ava, where the 
females are allowed to roam about the forests to some 
extent, and are thus placed under more natural con- 
ditions. The case of various American monkeys, both 
sexes of which have been kept for many years together 
in their own countries, and yet have very rarely or 
never bred, is a more apposite instance, because of 
their relationship to man. It is remarkable how 
slight a change in the conditions often induces 
sterility in a wild animal when captured ; and this is 
the more strange as all our domesticated animals have

become more fertile than they were in a state of 
nature; and some of them can resist the most 
unnatural conditions with undiminished fertility.***^ 
Certain groups of animals are much more liable than 
others to be affected by captivity ; and generally all 
the species of the same group are affected in the same 
manner. But sometimes a single species in a group 
is rendered sterile, whilst the others are not so; on 
the other hand, a single species may retain its fertility 
whilst most of the others fail to breed. The males 
and females of some species when confined, or when 
allowed to live almost, but not quite free, in their 
native country, never unite ; others thus circum- 
stanced frequently unite but never produce offspring ; 
others again produce some offspring, but fewer than in 
a state of nature ; and - as bearing on the above cases 
of man, it is important to remark that the young are 
apt to be weak and sickly, or malformed, and to perish 
at an early age. 

Seeing how general is this law of the susceptibility of 
the reproductive system to changed conditions of life, 
and that it holds good with our nearest allies, the 
Quadrumana, I can hardly doubt that it applies to 
man in his primeval state. Hence if savages of any 
race are induced suddenly to change their habits of 
life, they become more or less sterile, and their young 
offspring suffer in health, in the same manner and 
from the same cause, as do the elephant and hunting- 
leopard in India, many monkeys in America, and a 
host of animals of all kinds, on removal from their 
natural conditions. 

For the evideuoe on this head, see ‘ Variation of Animals,' 
&c., vol. ii. p. 111. 


Chap. VII. 


THE EXTINCTION OF RACES.

We can see why it is that aborigines, who have long 
inhabited islands, and who must have been long 
exposed to nearly uniform conditions, should be 
specially affected by any change in their habits, as 
seems to be the case. Civilised races can certainly 
resist changes of all kinds far better than savages ; 
and in this respect they resemble domesticated animals, 
for though the latter sometimes suffer in health 
(for instance European dogs in India), yet they are 
rarely rendered sterile, though a few such instances 
have been recorded.'*^ The immunity of civilised races 
and domesticated animals is probably due to their 
having been subjected to a greater extent, and there- 
fore having grown somewhat more accustomed, to 
diversified or varying conditions, than the majority of 
wild animals ; and to their having formerly im- 
migrated or been carried from country to country, and 
to different families or sub-races having inter-crossed. 
It appears that a cross with civilised races at once 
gives to an aboriginal race an immunity from the evil 
consequences of changed conditions. Thus the crossed 
offspring from the Tahitians and English, when 
settled in Pitcairn Island, increased so rapidly that 
the Island was soon overstocked; and in June 1856 
they were removed to Norfolk Island. They then 
consisted of 60 married persons and 134 children, 
making a total of 194. Here they likewise increased 
so rapidly, that although sixteen of them returned to 
Pitcairn Island in 1859, they numbered in January 
1868, 300 souls ; the males and females being in 
exactly equal numbers. What a contrast does this 
case present with that of the Tasmanians ; the 
‘ Variation of Animals,’ &c., vol. ii. p. 16. 


296 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part I. 


Norfolk Islanders increased in only twelve and a half 
years from 194 to 300 ; whereas the Tasmanians 
decreased during fifteen years from 120 to 46, of which 
latter number only ten were children.'^® 

So again in the interval between the census of 1866 
and 1872 the natives of full blood in the Sandwich 
Islands decreased by 8081, whilst the half-castes, who 
are believed to be healthier, increased by 847 ; but I 
do not know whether the latter number includes the 
offspring from the half-castes, or only the half-castes 
of the first generation. 

The cases which I have here given all relate to 
aborigines, who have been subjected to new conditions 
as the result of the immigration of civilised men. 
But sterility and ill-health would probably follow, if 
savages were compelled by any cause, such as the 
inroad of a conquering tribe, to desert their homes and 
to change their habits. It is an interesting circum- 
stance that the chief check to wild animals becoming 
domesticated, which implies the power of their breed- 
ing freely when first captured, and one chief check to 
wild men, when brought into contact with civilisation, 
surviving to form a civilised race, is the same, namely, 
sterility from changed conditions of life. 

Finally, although the gradual decrease and ultimate 
extinction of the races of man is a highly complex 
problem, depending on many causes which differ in 
different places and at different times ; it is the same 
problem as that presented by the extinction of one of

the higher animals — of the fossil horse, for instance, 
which disappeared from South America, soon after- 
wards to be replaced, within the same districts, by 
countless troups of the Spanish horse. The New 
Zealander seems conscious of this parallelism, for he 
compares his future fate with that of the native rat 
now almost exterminated by the European rat. 
Though the difficulty is great to our imagination, and 
really great, if we wish to ascertain the precise causes 
and their manner of action, it ought not to be so 
to our reason, as long as we keep steadily in mind that 
the increase of each species and each race is constantly 
checked in various ways; so that if any new check, 
even a slight one, be superadded, the race will surely 
decrease in number ; and decreasing numbers will 
sooner or later lead to extinction ; the end, in most 
cases, being promptly determined by the inroads of 
conquering tribes. 

On the Formation of the Races of Man . — In some 
cases the crossing of distinct races iias led to the 
formation of a new race. The singular fact that the 
Europeans and Hindoos, who belong to the same 
Aryan stock, and speak a language fundamentally the 
same, diffier widely in appearance, whilst Europeans 
iliffer but little from Jews, who belong to the Semitic 
stock, and speak quite another language, has been 
accounted for by Broca,'^^ through, certain Aryan 
branches having been largely crossed by indigenous 
tribes during their wide diffusion. When two races in 
close contact cross, the first result is a heterogeneous 
mixture : thus Mr. Hunter, in describing the Santali

or hill-tribes of India, says that hundreds of impercep- 
tible gradations may he traced “ from ihe black, squat 
"‘tribes of the mountains to the tall olive-coloured 
“ Brahman, with his intellectual brow, calm eyes, and 
“ high but narrow head ; ” so that it is necessary in 
courts of justice to ask the witnesses whether they 
arc Santalis or Hindoos.®" Whether a heterogeneous 
people, such as the inhabitants of some of the Poly- 
nesian islands, formed by the crossing of two distinct 
races, with few or no pure members left, would ever 
become homogeneous, is not known from direct evi- 
dence. But as with our domesticated animals, a cross- 
breed can certainly be fixed and made uniform by 
careful selection®^ in the course of a few generations, 
we may infer that the free intercrossing of a hetero- 
geneous mixture during a long descent would supply 
the place of selection, and overcome any tendency to 
reversion ; so that the crossed race would ultimately 
become homogeneous, though it might not partake in 
an equal degree of the characters of the two parent- 
races. 

Of all the differences between the races of man, the 
colour of the skin is the most conspicuous and one 
of the best marked. It was formerly thought that 
differences of this kind could be accounted for by 
long exposure to different climates ; but Pallas first 
shewed that this is not tenable, and he has since been 
followed by almost all anthropologists.®^ This view

has been rejected chiefly because the distribution of 
the variously coloured races, most of whom must have 
long inhabited their present homes, does not coincide 
with corresponding differences of climate. Some little 
weight may be given to such cases as that of the 
Dutch families, who, as we hear on excellent autho- 
rity,®^ have not undergone the least change of colour 
after residing for three centuries in South Africa. 
An argument on the same side may likewise be drawn 
from the uniform appearance in various parts of the 
world of gipsies and Jews, though the uniformity of 
the latter has been somewhat exaggerated.®^ A very 
damp or a very dry atmosphere has been supposed to 
be more influential in modifying the colour of the skin 
than mere heat ; but as D’Oibigny in South America, 
and Livingstone in Africa, arrived at diametrically 
opposite conclusions with respect to dampness and 
dryness, any conclusion on this head must be con- 
sidered as very doubtful.®® 

Various facts, which I have given elsewhere, prove 
that the colour of the skin and hair is sometimes 
correlated in a surprising manner with a complete 
immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons, 
and from the attacks of certain parasites. Hence it 
occurred to me, that negroes and other dark races might 
have acquired their dark tints by the darker individuals 
escaping from the deadly influence of the miasma 
of their native countries, during a long series of 
generations.

I afterwards found that this same idea had long ago 
occurred to Dr. Wells.®® It has long been known that 
negroes, and even mulattoes, are almost completely 
exempt from the yellow-fever, so destructive in tropical 
' America.®’ They likewise escape to a large extent the 
fatal intermittent fevers, that prevail along at least 
2600 miles of the shores of Africa, and which annually 
cause one-fifth of the white settlers to die, and another 
fifth to return home invalided.®® This immunity in the 
negro seems to be partly inherent, depending on some 
unknown peculiarity of constitution, and partly the 
result of acclimatisation. Pouchet ®® states that the 
negro regiments recruited near the Soudan, and bor- 
rowed from the Viceroy of Egypt for the Mexican war, 
escaped the yellow-fever almost equally with the 
negroes originally brought from various parts of Africa 
and accustomed to the' climate of the West Indies. 
That acclimatisation plays a part, is shewn by the 
many cases in which negroes have become somewhat 
liable to tropical fevers, after having resided for some 
time in a colder climate.®® The nature of the climate 
under which the white races have long resided, likewise

has some influence on them ; for during the fearful 
epidemic of yellow fever in Demerara during 1837, 
Dr. Blair found that the death-rate of the immigrants 
was proportional to the latitude of the country whence 
they had come. With the negro the immunity, as fai 
as it is the result of acclimatisation, implies exposure 
during a prodigious length of time ; for the aborigines 
of tropical America who have resided there from time 
immemorial, are not exempt from yellow fever ; and 
the Kev. H. B. Tristram states, that there are districts 
in Northern Africa which the native inhabitants are 
compelled annually to leave, though the negroes can 
remain with safety. 

That the immunity of the negro is in any degree 
correlated with the colour of his skin is a mere conjec- 
ture : it may be correlated with some difference in his 
blood, nervous system, or other tissues. Nevertheless, 
from the facts above alluded to, and from some connec- 
tion apparently existing between complexion and a 
tendency to consumption, the conjecture seemed to me 
not improbable. Consequently I endeavoured, with 
but little success,®^ to ascertain how far it holds good. 


In the spring of 1862 I 
obtained permission from the 
Director-General of the Medical 
department of the Army, to 
transmit to the surgeons of the

service a blank table, with the

The late Dr. Daniell, who had long lived on the West 
Coast of Africa, told me that he did not believe in any 
such relation. He was himself unusjially fair, and had 
.withstood the climate in a wonderful manner. When 
he first arrived as a hoy on the coast, an old and 
experienced negro chief predicted from his appearance 
that this would prove the case. Dr. Nicholson, of 
Antigua, after having attended to this subject, writes 
to me that dark-coloured Europeans escape the yellow 
fever more than those that are light-coloured. Mr. J. 
M. Harris altogether denies that Europeans with dark 
hair withstand a hot climate better than other men : 
on the contrary, experience has taught him in making 
a selection of men for service on the coast of Africa, 
to choose those with red hair.®^ As far, therefore, as 


“ would be so good as first to 
“ count, as a standard of com- 
“ parison, how many men, in 
“the force whence the sick are 
“drawn, have dark and light- 
“ coloured hair, and hair of 
“ intermediate or doubtful tints ; 
“ and if a similar account were 
“ kept by the same medical 
“ gentlemen, of all the men who 
“ suffered from malarious and 
“ yellow fevers, or from dysen- 
“ tery, it would soon be apparent, 
“after some thousand cases had 
“ been tabulated, whether there 
“exists any relation between 
“ the colour of the hair and con- 
“ stitutional liability to tropical 
“ diseases. Perhaps no such 
“relation would be discovered, 
“ but tho investigation is well 
“ worth making. In case any 
“positive result were obtained, 
“ it might be of some practical 
“ use in selecting men for any 


“ particular service. Theoreti-

“ high interest, as indicating 
“ one means by which a race of 
“ men inhabiting from a remote 
“ period an unh^calthy tropical

“dark-coloured by the better

these slight indications go, there seems no foundation 
for the hypothesis, that blackness has resulted from 
the darker and darker individuals having survived 
better during long exposure to fever-generating 
miasma. 

Dr. Sharpe remarks,®^ that a tropical sun, which 
burns and blisters a ’white skin, does not injure a black 
one at all ; and, as he adds, this is not due to habit in 
the individual, for children only six or eight months 
old are often carried about naked, and are not affected. 
I have been assured by a medical man, that some years 
ago during each summer, but not during the winter, 
his hands became marked with light brown patches, 
like, although larger than freckles, and that these 
patches were never affected by sun-burning, W'hilst the 
white parts of his skin have on several occasions been 
much inflamed and blistered. With the lower animals 
there is, also, a constitutional difference in liability to 
the action of the sun between those parts of the skin 
clothed with white hair and other parts.®^ Whether 
the saving of the skin from being thus burnt is of 
sufficient importance to account for a dark tint having 
been gradually acquired by man through natural 
selection, I am unable to judge. If it be so, we should 
have to assume that the natives of tropical America

negroes in Africa, or the Papuans in the southern parts 
of the Malay archipelago, just as the lighter-coloured 
Hindoos have resided in India for a shorter time than 
the darker aborigines of the central and southern parts 
of the peninsula. 

Although with our present knowledge we cannot 
account for the differences of colour in the races of man, 
through any advantage thus gained, or from the direct 
action of climate ; yet we must not quite ignore the 
latter agency, for there is good reason to believe that 
some inherited effect is thus produced.®^ 

We have seen in the second chapter that the con- 
ditions of life affect the development of the bodily frame 
in a direct manner, and that the effects are transmitted. 
Thus, as is generally admitted, the European settlers 
in the United States undergo a slight but extraordinary 
rapid change of appearance. Their bodies and limbs 
become elongated ; and I hear from Col. Bernys that 
during the late war in the United States, good evidence 
was afforded of this fact by the ridiculous appearance 
presented by the German regiments, when dressed in 
ready-made clothes manufactured for the American 
market, and which were much too long for the men in 
every way. There is, also, a considerable body of 
evidence shewing that in the Southern States the 


See, for instance, Quatre- 
fages (‘ Revue des Cours Scienti- 
fiques,’ Oct. 10, 1868, p. 724) 
on the effects of rt'.sidence in 
Abyssinia and Arabia, and other 
analogous cases. Dr. Rolle 
(‘ Der Mensch, seine Abstam- 
mung,’ &c., 1865, s. 99) states, 
on the authority of Khanikof, 
that the greater number of 


German families settled in 
Georgia, have acquired in the 
course of two generations dark 
hair and eyes. Mr. D. Forbes 
informs me that the Quichuas 
in the Andes vary greatly in 
colour, according to the position 
of the valleys inhabited by 
them. 


Chap. VII. THE FOKMATION OF KAOES. 305 

house-slaves of the third generation present a markedly 
different appearance from the field-slaves.®® 

If, however, we look to the races of man as dis- 
tributed over the world, we must infer that their 
characteristic differences cannot he accounted for by 
the direct action of different conditions of life, even 
after exposure to them for an enormous period of time. 
The Esquimaux live exclusively on animal food ; they 
are clothed in thick fur, and are exposed to intense 
cold and to prolonged darkness ; yet they do not differ 
in any extreme degree from the inhabitants of Southern 
China, who live entirely on vegetable food, and are 
exposed almost naked to a hot, glaring climate. The 
unclothed Fuegians live on the marine productions of 
their inhospitable shores; the Botocudos of Brazil 
wander about the hot forests of the interior and live 
chiefly on vegetable productions ; yet these tribes 
resemble each other so closely that the Fuegians on 
board the “ Beagle ” were mistaken by some Brazilians 
for Botocudos. The Botocudos again, as well as the 
other inhabitants of tropical America, are wholly 
different from the Negroes who inhabit the opposite 
shores of the Atlantic, are exposed to a nearly similar 
climate, and follow nearly the same habits of life. 

Nor can the differences between the races of man be 
accounted for by the inherited effects of the increased 
or decreased use of parts, except to a quite insignificant 
degree. Men who habitually live in canoes, may have 
their legs somewhat stunted ; those who inhabit lofty 
regions may have their chests enlarged; and those 
who constantly use certain sense-organs may have the

cavities in which they are lodged somewhat increased 
in size, and their features consequently a little modified. 
With civilised nations, the reduced size of the jaws 
from lessened use — the habitual play of different 
muscles serving to express different emotions — and the 
increased size of the brain from greater intellectual 
activity, have together produced a considerable effect 
on their general appearance when compared with 
savages.®’ Increased bodily stature, without any cor- 
responding increase in the size of the brain, may 
(judging from the previously adduced case of rabbits), 
have given to some races an elongated skull of the 
dolichocephalic type. 

Lastly, the little-understood principle of correlated 
development has sometimes come into action, as in 
the case of great muscular development and strongly 
projecting supra-orbital ridges. The colour of the 
skin and hair are plainly correlated, as is the texture 
of the hair with its colour in the Mandans of North 
America.®® The colour also of the skin, and the odour 
emitted by it, are likewise in some manner connected. 
With the breeds of sheep the number of hairs within 
a given space and the number of the excretory pores 
are related.®® If we may judge from the analogy of 
our domesticated animals, many modifications of

structure in man probably come under this principle 
of correlated development. 

We have now seen that the external characteristic 
differences between the races of man cannot be accounted 
for in a satisfactory manner by the direct action of the 
conditions of life, nor by the effects of the continued 
use of parts, nor through the principle of correlation 
We are therefore led to enquire whether slight indi- 
vidual differences, to which man is eminently liable, 
may not have been preserved and augmented during a 
long series of generations through natural selection. 
But here we are at once met by the objection that 
beneficial variations alone can be thus preserved ; and 
as far as we are enabled to judge, although always 
liable to err on this head, none of the differences 
between the races of man are of any direct or special 
service to him. The intellectual and moral or social 
faculties must of course be excepted from this remark. 
The great variability of all the external differences 
between the races of man, likewise indicates that they 
cannot be of much importance ; for if important, they 
would long ago have been either fixed and preserved, 
or eliminated. In this respect man resembles those 
forms, called by naturalists protean or polymorphic, 
which have remained extremely variable, owing, as it 
seems, to such variations being of an indifferent nature, 
and to their having thus escaped the action of natural 
selection. 

We have thus far been baffled in all our attempts to 
account for the differences between the races of man ; 
but there remains one important agency, namely 
{Sexual Selection, which appears to have acted power-

fully on man, as on many other animals. I do not 
intend to assert that sexual selection will account for 
all the differences between the races. An unexplained 
residuum is left, about which we can only say, in our 
ignorance, that as individuals are continually horn 
with, for instance, heads a little rounder or narrower, 
and with noses a little longer or shorter, such slight 
differences might become fixed and uniform, if the 
unknown agencies which induced them were to act in 
a more constant manner, aided by long-continued 
intercrossin;j. Such variations come under the pro- 
visional class, alluded to in our second chapter, which 
for the want of a better term are often called spon- 
taneous. Nor do I pretend that the effects of sexual 
selection can be indicated with scientific precision ; but 
it can he shewn that it would he an inexplicable fact 
if man had not been modified by this agency, which 
appears to have acted powerfully on innumerable 
animals. It can further be shewn that the differences 
between the races of man, as in colour, hairiness, form 
of features, &c., are of a kind which might have been 
expected to come under the influence of sexual selection. 
But in order to treat this subject properly, I have 
found it necessary to pass the whole animal kingdom 
in review. I have therefore devoted to it the Second 
Part of this work. At the close I shall return to man, 
and, after attempting to shew how far he has been 
modified through sexual selection, will give a brief 
summary of the chapters in this First Part,

STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN.

Note on the Resemblances and Diffekencesin the Strdctuke 

AND the Development of the Brain in Man and Apes. By 

Professor Huxley, F.Pi.S. 

'J'lie controversy respecting the nature and the extent of the differ- 
ences in the structure of the brain in man and the apes, which arose 
some fifteen years ago, has not yet come to an end, though the 
subject matter of the dispute is, at present, totally different from 
what it was formerly. It was originally asserted and re-asserted, 
with singular pertinacity, that the biain of all the apes, even the 
highest, differs from that of man, in the absence of such conspicuous 
structures as the posterior lobes of the cerebral hemispheres, with 
the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus 
minor y contained in those lobes, which are so obvious in man. 

But the truth that the three structures in question are as well 
developed in apes’ as in human brains, or even better ; and that it 
is characteristic of all the Primates (if we exclude the Lemurs) to 
have these parts well developed, stands at present on as secure a 
basis as any proposition in comparative anatomy. Moreover, it is 
admitted by every one of the long series of anatomists who, of late 
years, have paid special attention to the arrangement of the compli- 
cated sulci and gyri which appear upon the surface of the cerebral 
hemispheres in man and the higher apes, that tliey are disposed 
after tlie very same pattern in him, as in them. Every principal 
gyrus and sulcus of a chimpanzee’s brain is clearly represented in 
that of a man, so that the terminology which applies to the one 
answers for the other. On this point there is no difference of 
opinion. Some years since. Professor Bischoff published a memoir 
on the cerebral convolutions of man and apes ; and as the purpose 
of my learned colleague was certainly not to diminish the value of 
the differences between apes and men in this respect, I am glad to 
make a citation from him. 

“ That the apes, and especially the orang, chimpanzee and gorilla, 
“ come very close to man in their organisation, much nearer than 
“ to any other animal, is a well knoi\Ti fact, disputed by nobody. 
“Looking at the matter from the point of view of organisation

“ alone, no one probably would ever bave disputed the view of 
“ liinnseus, that man should be placed, merely as a peculiar species, at 
“ the head of the mammalia and of those apes. Both shew, in all 
“ their organs, so close an affinity, that the most exact anatomical 
' “ investigation is needed in order to demonstrate those differences 

which really exist. So it is with the brains. The brains of man, 
“ theorang, the chimpanzee, the gorilla, in spite of all the important 
“differences which they present, come very close to one another” 
“ (1. c. p. 101). 

There remains, then, no dispute as to the resemblance in funda- 
mental characters, between the ape’s brain and man’s ; nor any as 
to the wonderfully close similarity between the chimpanzee, 
orang and man, in even the details of the arrangement of the gyri 
and sulci of the cerebral hemispheres. Nor, turning to the differ- 
ences between the brains of the highest apes and that of man, is 
there any serious question as to the nature and extent of these 
differences. It is admitted that the man’s cerebral hemispheres 
are absolutely and relatively larger than those of the orang and 
chimpanzee ; that his frontal lobes are less excavated by the 
upward protrusion of the roof of the orbits; that his gyri and sulci 
are, as a rule, less symmetrically disposed, and present a greater 
number of secondary plications. And it is admitted that, as a rule, 
in man, the temporo-occipital or “ external perpendicular ” fissure, 
which is usually so strongly marked a feature of the ape’s brain is 
but faintly marked. But it also clear, that none of these differences 
constitutes a sharp demarcation between the man’s and the ape’s 
brain. In respect to the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet, 
in the human brain for instance. Professor Turner remarks 

“In some brains it appears simply as an indentation of the 
“ margin of the hemisphere, but, in others, it extends for some 
“ distance more or less transversely outwards. I saw it in the right 
“ hemisphere of a female brain pass more than two inches outwards ; 
“ and on another specimen, also the right hemisphere, it proceeded 
“ for four-tenths of an inch outwards, and then extended dowm- 
“ wards, as far as the lower margin of the outer surface of the 
“ hemisphere. The imperfect definition of this fissure in the majority 
“ of human brains, as compared with its remarkable distinctness in 
“the brain of most Quadrumana, is owing to the presence, in the 


‘ Convolutions of the Human Cerebrum To|X)graphically 
Considered,’ 186G, p. 12. 


Chap. VII.

“ former, of certain superficial, well marked, secondary convolutions 
“ which bi-idge it over and connect the parietal with the occipital 
“ lobe. The closer the first of these bridging gyri lies to the longi- 
“ tudinal fissure, the shorter is the external parieto-occipital fissure.” 

(1. c. p. 12.) 

The obhteration of the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet, 
therefore, is not a constant character of the human brain. On the 
other hand, its fuU development is not a constant character of the 
higher ape’s brain. For, in the chimpanzee, the more or less 
extensive obliteration of the external perpendicular sulcus by 
“ bridging convolutions,” on one side or the other, has been noted 
over and over again by Prof. Rolleston, Mr. Marshall, M. Broca and 
Professor Turner. At the conclusion of a special paper on this 
subject the latter writes ; 

“The three specimens of the brain ofa chimpanzee just described, 
“prove, that the generalisation which Gratiolet has attempted to 
“ draw of the complete absence of the first connecting convolution 
“ and the concealment of the second, as essentially characteristic 
“ features in the brain of this animal, is by no means universallj! 
“ apifiicable. In only one specimen did the brain, in these par- 
“ ticulars, follow the law which Gratiolet has expressed. As 
“ regards the presence of the superior bridging convolution, I am 
“ inclined to think that it has existed in one hemisphere, at least, 
“ in a majority of the brains of this animal which have, up to this 
“ time, been figured or described. The superficial position of the 
“ second bridging convolution is evidently less frequent, and has as 
“ yet, I believe, only been seen in the brain (A) recorded in this 
“communication. The asymmetiical arrangement in the convo- 
“lutions of the two hemispheres, which previous observers have 
“ referred to in their descriptions, is also well illustrated in these 
“ specimens.” (pp. 8, 9.) 

Even were the presence of the temporo-occipital, or external per- 
pendicular, sulcus, a mark of distinction between the higher apes 
and man, the value of such a distinctive character would be ren- 
dered very doubtful by the structure of the brain in the Platyrhine 
apes. In fact, while the temporo-occipital is one of the most 
constant of sulci in the Catarhine, or Old World, apes, it is never

very strongly developed in the New World apes; it is absent in 
the smaller Platyrhini ; rudimentary in Pithecia and more or 
less obliterated by bridging convolutions in Ateles. 

A character which is thus variable within the limits of a single 
group can have no great taxonomic value. 

It is further established, that the degree of asymmetry of the 
convolution of the two sides in the human brain is subject to much 
individual variation ; and that, in those individuals of the Bush- 
man race who have been examined, the gyri and sulci of the two 
hemispheres are considerably less complicated and more symmetri- 
cal than in the European brain, while, in some individuals of the 
chimpanzee, their complexity and asymmetry become notable. 
This is particularly the case in the brain .of a young male chim- 
panzee figured by M. Broca. (‘ L’ordre des Primates,’ p. 165, 
fig. 11.) 

Again, as respects the question of absolute size, it is established 
that the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy 
human brain is greater than the difference between the smallest 
healthy human brain and the largest chimpanzee’s or orang’s brain. 

Moreover, there is one circumstance in which the orang’s and 
chimpanzee’s brains resemble man’s, but in which they differ from 
the lower apes, and that is the presence of two corpora candicantia 
— the Oynomorpha having but one. 

In view of these facts I do not hesitate in this year 1874, to 
repeat and insist upon the proposition which I enunciated in 
1863 :'^" 

“ So far as cerebral structure goes, therefore, it is clear that man 
“ differs less from the chimpanzee or the orang, than these do even 
“ from the monkeys, and that the difference between the brain of 
“ the chimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when com- 
“ pared with that between the chimpanzee brain and that of a 
“ Lemur.” 

In the paper to which I have referred. Professor Bischoff does not 
deny the second part of this statement, but he first makes the 
irrelevant remark that it is not wonderful if the brains of an orang 
and a Lemur are very different; and secondlj^ goes on to assert 
that, “ If we successively compare the brain of a m m with that of

“an orang; the brain of this with that of a chimpanzee, of this 
“ with that of a gorilla, and so on of a Hylobates, Semnopithecus, 
“ GynocephaluSj Cercopithecus, Macacics, Cebus, CalUthrix^ Lemur ^ 
“ Stenops, Hayale, we shall not meet with a greater, or even as 
“great a, break in the degree of development of the convolutions, 
“ as we find between the brain of a man and that of an orang or 
“ chimpanzee.” 

To which I reply, firstly, that whether this assertion be true or 
false, it has nothing whatever to do with the proposition enunciated 
in ‘ Man’s Place in Nature,’ which refers not to the development of 
the convolutions alone, but to the structure of the v^hole brain. If 
Piofessor BischofiF had taken the trouble to refer to p. 96 of the 
work he criticises, in fact, he would have found the following 
p \ssage : “ And it is a remarkable circumstance that though, so far 
“ as our present knowledge extends, there is one true structural 
“break in the series of forms of Simian brains, this hiatus does not 
“ lie between man and the manlike apes, but between the lower and 
“the lowest Simians, or in other words, between the Old and New 
“ World apes and monkeys and the Lemurs. Every Lemur which 
“has yet been examined, in fact, has its cerebellum partially visible 
“from above; and its posterior lobe, with the contained posterior 
“cornu and hippocampus minor, more or less rudimentary. Every 
“marmoset, American monkey, Old World monkey, baboon, or 
“ manlike ape, on the contrary, has its cerebellum entirely hidden, 
“ posteriorly, by the cerebral lobes, and possesses a large posterior 
“ cornu with a well-developed hippocampus minor.” 

This statement was a strictly accurate account of what was 
known when it was made; and it does not appear to me to be more 
/han apparently weakened by the subsequent discovery of the 
relatively small development of the posterior lobes in the Siamang 
and in the Howling monkey. Notwithstanding the exceptional 
brevity of the posterior lobes in these two species, no one will 
pretend that their brains, in the slightest degree, approach those of 
the Lemurs. And if, instead of putting Hapale out of its natural 
place, as Professor Bischoff most unaccountably does, we write the 
series of animals he has chosen to mention as follows : Homo, 
Pitheensj Troglodytes, Hylohufes, Semnopithecus, Cynocephalus, 
Cercopithecus, Macacus, Cebus, Callithrix, Hapale, Lemur, Stenops, 
1 venture to reaffirm that the great break in this series lies between 
Hapale and Lemur, and that this break is considerably greater than 
that between any other two terms of that series. Professor Bischoff

Part T. 


ignores the fact tliat long before he wrote, Graiiolet had suggested 
the separation of the Lemurs from the other Primates on the very 
ground of the difference in their cerebral characters; and that 
Professor Flower had made the following observations in the course 
of his description of the brain of the Javan Loris : 

“ And it is especially remarkable that, in the development of the 
“posterior lobes, there is no approximation to the Lemurine, short 
“hemisphered brain, in those monkeys which are commonly sup- 
“ posed to approach this family in other respects, viz., the lower 
“members of the Platyrhine group.” 

So ffir as the structure of the adult brain is concerned, then, the 
very considerable additions to our knowledge, which have been made 
by the researches of so many investigators, during the past ten 
years, fully justify the statement which I made in 1863. But it has 
been said, that, admitting the similarity between the adult brains of 
man and apes, they are nevertheless, in reality,* widel}^ different, 
because they exhibit fundamental differences in the mode of their 
development. No one would be more ready than I to admit the 
force of this argument, if such fundamental differences of develop- 
ment really exist. But I deny that they do exist. On the contrary, 
there is a fundamental agreement in the development of the brain in 
men and apes. 

Gratiolet originated the statement that there is a fundamental 
difference in the development of the brains of apes and that of man 
— consisting in this ; that, in the apes, the sulci which first make 
their appearance are situated on the posterior region of the cerebral 
hemispheres, while, in the human foetus, the sulci first become 
visible on the frontal lobes.'^® 

This general statement is based upon two observations, the one of 
a Gibbon almost ready to be born, in which the posterior gyii were 
“ well developed,” while those of the frontal lobes were “ hardly

“ Le reste de la surface cdrebrale est encore absolument lisse.” 

Three views of this brain are given in Plate II. figs. 1, 2, 3, of 
the work cited, shewing the upper, lateral and inferior views of the 
hemispheres, but not the inner view. It is worthy of note tluit the 
figure by no means bears out Gratiolet’s description, inasmuch as 
the fissure (antero-temporal) on the posterior half of the face of the 
hemisphere is more marked than any of those vaguely indicated in 
the anterior half. If the figure is correct, it in no way justifies 
Gratiolet’s conclusion : “ II y a done entre ces cerveaux [those Of a 
“ Callithrix and of a Gibbon] et celui du foetus humain une difference 
“ fondamental. Chez cdui-ci, longtemps avant que les plis tempo- 
“ raux apparaissent, les plis frentaux essayent d’exister.” 

Since Gratiolet’s time, however, the development of the gyri and 
sulci of the brain has been made the subject of renewed investigation

whose work is not only the latest, but by far the most complete, 
memoir on the subject. 

The final results of’ their inquiries may be summed uj) as 
follows . — 

1. In the human foetus, the sylvian fissure is formed in the course 
of the third month of utei ogestation. In this, and in the fourth 
month, the cerebral hemispheres are smooth and rounded (with the 
exception of the sylvian depression), and they project backwards far 
beyond the cerebellum. 

2. The sulci, properly so called, begin to appear in the interval 
between the end of the fourth and the beginning of the sixth month 
of foetal life, but Ecker is careful to point out that, not only the 
time, but the order, of their appearance is subject to considerable 
individual variation. In no case, however, are either the frontal or 
the temporal sulci the earliest. 

The first which appears, in fact, lies on the inner face of the hemi- 
sphere (whence doubtless Gratiolet, who does not seem to have ex- 
amined that face in his foetus, overlooked it), and is either the 
internal perpendicular (occipito-parietal), or the calcarine sulcus, 
these two being close together and eventually running into one 
another. As a rule the occipito-parietal is the earlier of the two. 

3. At the latter part of this period, another sulcus, the “ posterio- 
parietal,” or “ Fissure of Kolando is developed, and it is followed, in 
the course of the sixth month, by the other principal sulci of the 
frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. There is, bowevei-, 
no clear evidence that one of these constantly ajipears before the 
other; and it is remarkable that, in the brain at the period described 
and figured by Ecker (1. c. p. 212-13, Taf. II. figs. 1, 2, 3, 4), the 
antero-temporal sulcus (scissure par allele) so characteristic of the 
ape’s brain, is as well, if not better developed than the fissure of 
Rolando, and is much more marked than the proper frontal sulci. 

Taking the facts as they now stand, it appears to me that the 
order of the appearance of the sulci and gyri in the foetal human 
brain is in perfect harmony with the general doctrine of evolution, 
and with the view that man has been evolved from some ape-like 
form ; though there can be no doubt that that form was, in many 
respects, different from any member of the Primates now living. 

Von Baer taught us, half a century ago, that, in the course of 
their development, allied animals put on at first, the characters of 
the greater groups to which they belong, and, by degi-ees, assume 
those which restrict them within the limits of their family, genus.

and species ; and he proved, at the same time, that no develop- 
mental stage of a higher animal is precisely similar to the adult 
condition of any lower animal. It is quite correct to say that a 
frog passes through the condition of a fish, inasmuch as at one 
period of its life the tadpole has all the characters of a fish, and if 
it went no further, would have to he grouped among fishes. But it 
is equally true tliat a tadpole is very different from any known fish. 

In like manner, the brain of a human foetus, at the fifth month, 
may correctly be said to be, not only the brain of an ape, but that 
of an Arctopithecine or marmoset-like ape; for its hemispheres, 
with their great posterior lobster, and with no sulci but the sylvian 
and the calcarine, present the characteristics found only in the group 
of the Arctopithecine Primates. But it is equally true, as Gratiolet 
remarks, that, in its widely open sylvian fissure, it differs from the 
brain of any actual marmoset. No doubt it would be much more 
similar to the brain of an advanced foetus of a marmoset. But w e 
know nothing whatever of the development of the brain in the 
mannosets. In the Platyrhini proper, the only observation with 
which I am acquainted is due to Pansch, who found in the brain of 
a foetal Cehus Amelia, in addition to the sylvian fissure and the deep 
calcarine fissure, only a very shallow antero-temporal fissure (scissure 
parallele of Gratiolet). 

Now this fact, taken together with the circumstance that the 
antero-temporal sulcus is present in such Platyrhini as the Saimiri, 
which present mere traces of sulci on the anterior half of the ex- 
terior of the cerebral hemispheres, or none at all, undoubtedly, so far 
as it goes, affords fair evidence in favour of Gratiolet’s hypothesis, 
tliat the posterior sulci appear before the anterior, in the brains of 
the Platyrhini. But, it by no moans follows, that the rule which 
may hold good for the Platyrhini extends to the Catarhini. We 
have no information whatever resjiecting the development of the 
brain in the Cynomorpha; and, as regards the Anthropomorpha, 
nothing but the account of the biain of the Gibbon, near birth, 
already referred to. At the present moment there is not a shadow 
of evidence to shew that the sulci of a chimpanzee’s, or orang’s, 
brain do not appear in the same order as a man’s. 

Gratiolet opens his preface with the aphorism : “11 est dangeieux 
“ dans les sciences de conclure trop vite.” T fear he must have for- 
gotten this sound maxim by the time he had reached the discussion 
of the differences between men and apes, in the body of his work. 
No doubt, the excellent author of one of the most remarkable

contributions to the just understanding of the mammalian brain 
which has ever been made, would have been the first to admit the 
insufficiency of his data had he lived to profit by the advance of 
inquiry. The misfortune is that his conclusions have been em- 
ployed by persons incompetent to appreciate their foundation, as 
arguments iq favour of obscurantism.*® 

But it is important to remark that, whether Gratiolet was right 
or wrong in his hypothesis respecting the relative order of ap- 
pearance of the temporal and frontal sulci, the fact remains ; that, 
before either temporal or frontal sulci, appear, the foetal brain of 
man presents characters which are found onh' in the lowest group 
of the Primates (leaving out the Lemurs) ; and that this is exactly 
what we should expect to be the case, if man has resulted from the 
gradual modification of the same form as that from which the other 
Primates have sprung.

With animals wPich have their sexes separated, the 
males necessarily differ from the females in their 
organs of reproduction ; and these are the primary 
sexual characters. But the sexes often differ in what 
Hunter has called secondary sexual characters, which 
are not directly connected with the act of reproduc- 
tion ; for instance, the male possesses certain organs of 
sense or locomotion, of which the female is quite 
destitute, or has them more highly-developed, in order 
that he may readily find or reach her ; or again the 


320

male lias special organs of prehension for holding 
her securely. These latter organs, of infinitely diver- 
sified kinds, graduate into those which are commonly 
ranked as primary, and in some cases can hardly he 
distinguished from them ; we see instances of this in the 
complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in 
male insects. Unless indeed we confine the term 
“ primary ” to the reproductive glands, it is scarcely 
possible to decide which ought to be called primary 
and which secondary. 

The female often differs from the male in having 
organs for the nourishment or protection of her young, 
such as the mammary glands of mammals, and the 
abdominal sacks of the marsupials. In some few cases 
also the male possesses similar organs, which are 
wanting in the female, such as the receptacles for the 
ova in certain male fishes, and those temporarily deve- 
loped in certain male frogs. The females of most bees 
are provided with a special apparatus for collecting and 
carrying pollen, and their ovipositor is modified into a 
sting for the defence of the larvae and the community. 
Many similar cases could be given, but they do not 
here concern us. There are, however, other sexual 
differences quite unconnected with the primary repro- 
ductive organs, and it is with these that we are more 
especially concerned — such as the greater size, strength, 
and pugnacity of the male, his weapons of offence or 
means of defence against rivals, his gaudy colouring 
and various ornaments, his power of song, and other 
such characters. 

Besides the primary and secondary sexual differences, 
such as the foregoing, the males and females of some 
animals differ in structures related to different habits

01 life, and not at all, or only indirectly, to the repro- 
ductive functions. Thus the females of certain flies 
(Culicidae and Tabanidae) are blood-suckers, whilst the 
males, living on flowers, have mouths destitute of 
mandibles.^ The males of certain moths and of some 
crustaceans (e,g. Tanais) have imperfect, closed mouths, 
and cannot feed. The complemental males of certain 
Cirripedes live like epiphytic plants either on the 
female or the hermaphrodite form, and are destitute 
of a mouth and of prehensile limbs. In these cases it 
is the male which has been modified, and has lost 
certain important organs, which the females possess. 
In other cases it is the female which has lost such 
parts ; for instance, the female glow-worm is destitute 
of wings, as also are many female moths, some of 
which never leave their cocoons. Many female 
parasitic crustaceans have lost their natatory legs. In' 
some weevil-beetles (Curculionidae) there is a great 
difi’erence between the male and female in the length 
of the rostrum or snout ; ^ hut the meaning of this and 
of many analogous differences, is not at all understood. 
Differences of structure between the two sexes in 
relation to different habits of life are generally con- 
fined to the lower animals ; but with some few birds 
the beak of the male differs from that of the female. In 
the Huia of New Zealand tne difference is wonderfully 
great, and we hear from Dr. Duller^ that the male 
uses his strong beak in chiselling the larvae of insects 
out of decayed wood, whilst the female probes the

softer parts with her far longer, much curved and 
pliant beak : and thus they mutually aid each other. 
In most cases, differences of structure between the 
sexes are more or less directly connected with the 
propagation of the species: thus a female, which 
has to nourish a multitude of ova, requires more 
food than the male, and consequently requires special 
means for procuring it. A male animal, which lives 
for a very short time, might lose its organs for pro- 
curing food through disuse, without detriment ; hut he 
would retain his locomotive organs in a perfect state, 
so that he might reach the female. The female, on the 
other hand, might safely lose her organs for flying, 
swimming, or walking, if she gradually acquired habits 
which rendered such powers useless. 

We are, however, here concerned only with sexual 
selection. This depends on the advantage which 
certain individuals have over others of the same sex 
and species solely in respect of reproduction. When, 
as in the cases above mentioned, the two sexes differ in 
structure in relation to different habits of life, they 
have no doubt been modified through natural selection, 
and by inheritance limited to one and the same sex. 
So again the primary sexual organs, and those for 
nourishing or protecting the young, come under the 
same influence ; for those individuals which generated 
or nourished their offspring best, would leave, cseteris 
'paribus, the greatest number to inherit their superi- 
ority; whilst those which generated or nourished 
their offspring badly, would leave but few to inherit 
their weaker powers. As the male has to find the 
female, he requires organs of sense and locomotion, 
but if these organs are necessary for the other 


Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


323 


purposes of life, as is generally the case, they will 
have been developed through natural selection. When 
the male has found the female, he sometimes absolutely 
requires prehensile organs to hold her; thus Dr. 
Wallace informs me that the males of certain moths 
cannot unite with the females if their tarsi or feet are 
broken. The males of many oceanic crustaceans, when 
adult, have their legs and antennae modified in an ex- 
traordinary manner for the prehension of the female ; 
hence we may suspect that it is because these animals 
are washed about by the waves of the open sea, that 
they require these organs in order to propagate their 
kind, and if so, their development has been the result of 
ordinary or natural selection. Some animals extremely 
low in the scale have been modified for this same 
purpose; thus the males of certain parasitic worms, when 
fully grown, have the lower surface of the terminal part 
of their bodies roughened like a rasp, and with this they 
coil round and permanently hold the females.^ 

When the two sexes follow exactly the same habits 
of life, and the male has the sensory or locomotive 
organs more highly developed than those of the female, 
it may be that the perfection of these is indispensable 


* M. Perrier advances this 
case (* Kevue Scientifique,’ Feb. 
1, 1873, p. 865) as one fatal to 
the beUef in sexual selection, 
inasmuch as he supposes that I 
attribute all the differences 
between the sexes to sexual 
selection. This distinguished 
naturalist, therefore, like so 
many other Frenchmen, has not 
taken the trouble, to understand 
even the first principles of sexual 
selection. An English naturalist 


insists that the claspers of 
certain male animals could not 
have been developed through 
the choice of the female ! Had 
I not met with this remark, I 
should not have thought it 
possible for any one to have 
read this chapter and to have 
imagined that I maintain that 
the choice of the female had 
anything to do with the deve- 
lopment of the prehensile organ? 
in the male. 


324 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part II. 


to the male for finding the female ; but in the vast 
majority of cases, they serve only to give one male an 
advantage over nnother, for with sufficient time, the 
Jess well-endowed males would succeed in pairing with 
the females ; and judging from the structure of the 
female, they would he in all other respects equally 
well adapted for their ordinary habits of life. Since 
in such cases the males have acquired their present 
structure, not from being better fitted to survive in the 
struggle for existence, but from having gained an 
advantage over other males, and from having trans- 
mitted this advantage to their male offspring alone, 
sexual selection must here have come into action. It 
was the importance of this distinction which led me to 
designate this form of selection , as Sexual Selection. 
So again, if the chief service rendered to the male by 
his prehensile organs is to prevent the escape of the 
female before the arrival of other males, or when 
assaulted by them, these organs will have been perfected 
through sexual selection, that is by the advantage 
acquired by certain individuals over their rivals. But 
in most cases of this kind it is impossible to distinguish 
between the effects of natural and sexual selection. 
Whole chapters could be filled with details on the differ- 
ences between the sexes in their sensory, locomotive, 
and prehensile organs. As, however, these structures 
are not more interesting than others adapted for the 
ordinary purposes of life I shall pass them over almost 
entirely, giving only a few instances under each class. 

There are many other structures and instincts which 
must have been developed through sexual selection — 
such as the weapons of offence and the means of defence 
of the males for fighting with and drivvug away their 


Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


325 


rivals — their courage and pugnacity — their various 
ornaments — their contrivances for producing vocal or 
instrumental music — and their glands for emitting 
odours, most of these latter structures serving only to 
allure or excite the female. It is clear that these cha- 
racters are the result of sexual and not of ordinary se- 
lection, since unarmed, unornamented, or unattractive 
males would succeed equally well in the battle for life 
and in leaving a numerous progeny, but for the presence 
of better endowed males. We may infer that this would 
be the case, because the females, which are unarmed and 
unornamented, are able to survive and procreate their 
kind. Secondary sexual characters of the kind just 
referred to, will be fully discussed in the following 
chapters, as being in many respects interesting, but 
especially as depending on the will, choice, and rivalry 
of the individuals of either sex. When we behold two 
males fighting for the possession of the female, or 
several male birds displaying their gorgeous plumage, 
and performing strange antics before an assembled 
body of females, we cannot doubt that, though led by in- 
stinct, they know what they are about, and consciously 
exert their mental and bodily powers. 

Just as man can improve the breed of his game-cocks 
by the selection of those birds which are victorious in 
the cockpit, so it appears that the strongest and most 
vigorous males, or those provided with the best 
weapons, have prevailed under nature, and have led to 
the improvement of the natural breed or species. A 
slight degree of variability leading to some advantage, 
however slight, in reiterated deadly contests would 
suffice for the work of sexual selection; and it is 
certain that secondary sexual characters are eminently 


326 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part IL 


variable. Just as man can give beauty, according to 
his standard of taste, to his male poultry, or more 
strictly can modify the beauty originally acquired by 
the parent species, can give to the Sebright bantam a 
new and elegant plumage, an erect and peculiar 
carriage — so it appears that female birds in a state of 
nature, have by a long selection of the more attractive 
males, added to their beauty or other attractive quali- 
ties. No doubt this implies powers of discrimination 
and taste on the part of the female which will at first 
appear extremely improbable ; but by the facts to be 
adduced hereafter, I hope to be able to shew that the 
females actually have these powers. When, however, 
it is said that the lower animals have a sense of beauty, 
it must not be supposed that such sense is comparable 
with that of a cultivated man, with his multiform and 
complex associated ideas. A more just comparison would 
be between the taste for the beautiful in animals, and 
that in the lowest savages, who admire and deck them- 
selves with any brilliant, glittering, or curious object. 

From our ignorance on several points, the precise 
manner in which sexual selection acts is somewhat 
uncertain. Nevertheless if those naturalists who 
already believe in the mutability of species, will read 
the following chapters, they will, I think, agree with 
me, that sexual selection has played an important part 
in the history of the organic world. It is certain that 
amongst almost all animals there is a struggle between 
the males for the possession of the female. This fact 
is so notorious that it would be superfluous to give 
instances. Hence the females have the opportunity of 
selecting one out of several males, on the supposition 
that their mental capacity suffices for the exertion of a 


ohap. vm. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


327 


choice. In many cases special circumstances tend to 
make the struggle between the males particularly severe. 
Thus the males of our migratory birds generally arrive 
at their places of breeding before the females, so that 
many males are ready to contend for each female. I 
am informed by Mr. Jenner Weir, that the bird-catchers 
assert that this is invariably the case with the night- 
ingale and blackcap, and with respect to the latter he 
can himself confirm the statement. 


Mr. Swaysland of Brighton has been in the habit, 
during the last forty years, of catching our mi- 
gratory birds on their first arrival, and he has never 
known the females of any species to arrive before their 
males. During one spring he shot thirty-nine males 
of Kay’s wagtail {Budytes Ban) before he saw a single 
female. Mr. Gould has ascertained by the dissection 
of those snipes which arrive the first in this country, 
that the males come before the females. -And the like 


holds good with most of the migratory birds of the 
United States.® The majority of the male salmon in 
our rivers, on coming up from the sea, are ready to 
breed before the females. So it appears to be with 
frogs and toads. Throughout the great class of insects 
the males almost always are the first to emerge from 
the pupal state, so that they generally abound for a 
time before any females can be seen.® The cause of

‘ Mammals and Winter Birds of 
Florida,’ Bull. Comp. Zoology, 
Harvard College, p. 268. 

® Even with those plants in 
which the sexes are separate, the 
male flowers are generally 
mature before the female. As 
first shewn by C. K. Sprengel, 
many hermaphrodite plants are 


dichogamous ; that is, their 
male and female organs are not 
ready at the same time, so that 
they cannot be self-fertilised. 
Now in such flowers, the pollen 
is in general matured before the 
stigma, though there are excep- 
tional cases in which the female 
organs are beforehand. 


328 


THE DESCENT OP MAN. 


Part II. 


this difference between the males and females in their 
periods of arrival and maturity is sufficiently obvious. 
Those males which annually first migrated into any 
country, or which in the spring were first ready to 
breed, or were the most eager, would leave the largest 
number of offspring ; and these would tend to inherit 
similar instincts and constitutions. It must be borne in 
mind that it would have been impossible to change 
very materially the time of sexual maturity in the 
females, without at the same time interfering with the 
period of the production of the young — a period which 
must be determined by the seasons of the year. On 
the whole there can be no doubt that with almost all 
animals, in which the sexes are separate, there is a 
constantly recurrent struggle between the males for 
the possession of the females. 

Our difficulty in regard to sexual selection lies in 
understanding how it is that the males which conquer 
other males, or those which prove the most attractive 
to the females, leave a greater number of offspring to 
inherit their superiority than their beaten and less 
attractive rivals. Unless this result does follow, the 
characters which give to certain males an advantage 
over others, could not be perfected and augmented 
through sexual selection. When the sexes exist in 
exactly equal numbers, the worst-endowed males will 
(except where polygamy prevails), ultimately find 
females, and leave as many offspring, as well fitted for 
their general habits of life, as the best-endowed males. 
From various facts and considerations, I formerly 
inferred that with most animals, in which secondary 
sexual characters are well developed, the males con- 
siderably exceeded the females in number ; but this is 


Chap VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


329 


not by any means always true. If the males were to 
the females as two to one, or as three to two, or even 
in a somewhat lower ratio, the whole affair would be 
simple ; for the better-armed or more attractive males 
would leave the largest number of offspring. But 
after investigating, as far as possible, the numerical 
proportion of the sexes, I do not believe that any great 
inequality in number commonly exists. In most cases 
sexual selection appears to have been effective in the 
following manner. 

Let us take any species, a bird for instance, and 
divide the females inhabiting a district into two equal 
bodies, the one consisting of the more vigorous and 
better-nourished individuals, and the other of the less 
vigorous and healthy. The former, there can be little 
doubt, would be ready to breed in the spring before the 
others; and this is the opinion of Mr. Jenner Weir, 
who has carefully attended to the habits of birds 
during many years. There can also be no doubt 
that the most vigorous, best-nourished and earliest 
breeders would on an average succeed in rearing the 
largest number of fine offspring.^ The males, as we 
have seen, are generally ready to breed before the 
females ; the strongest, and with some species the best 
armed of the males, drive away the weaker ; and the 
former would then unite with the more vigorous and 
better-nourished females, because they are the first 


■^Here is excellent evidence 
on the character of the offspring 
from an experienced ornitholo- 
gist. Mr. J. A. Allen, in speak- 
ing (‘ Mammals and Winter 
Birds of E. Florida,’ p. 229) of 
the later broods, after the acci- 
dental destruction of the first, 
says, that these “ are found to 


“be smaller and paler-coloured 
“ than those hatched earlier in 
“ the season. In cases where 
“ several broods are reared each 
“ year, as a general rule the 
“ birds of the earlier broods seem 
“ in all respects the most perfect 
“ and vigorous.” 


330 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part II. 


to breed.® Such vigorous pairs would surely rear a 
larger number of offspring than the retarded females, 
which would be compelled to unite with the conquered 
and less powerful males, supposing the sexes to be 
numerically equal ; and this is all that is wanted to 
add, in the course of successive generations, to the 
size, strength and courage of the males, or to improve 
their weapons. 

But in very many, cases the males which conquer 
their rivals, do not obtain possession of the females, 
independently of the choice of the latter. The court- 
ship of animals is by no means so simple and short an 
affair as might be thought. The females are most 
excited by, or prefer pairing with, the more orna- 
mented males, or those which are the best songsters, 
or play the best antics ; but it is obviously probable 
that they would at the same time prefer the more 
vigorous and lively males, and this has in some cases 
been confirmed by actual observation.® Thus the more 
vigorous females, which are the first to breed, will 
have the choice of many males ; and though they may 
not always select the strongest or best armed, they . 
will select those which are vigorous and well armed, 
and in other respects the most attractive. Both sexes, 
therefore, of such early pairs would as above explained, 
have an advantage over others in rearing offspring ; 


® Hermann Miiller has come 
to this same conclusion with 
respect to those female bees 
which are the first to emerge 
from the pupa each year. See 
his remarkable essay, ‘ An wen- 
dung den Darwin'schen Lehre 
auf Bienen,’ ‘ Verb. d. Y. Jahrg.’ 
xxix. p, 45. 


® With respect to poultry, I 
have received information, here- 
after to be given, to this effect. 
Even with birds, such as pigeons, 
which pair for life, the female, as 
I hear from Mr. Jenner Weir, 
will desert her mate if he is 
injured or grows weak. 


Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


331 


and this apparently has sufficed during a long course 
of generations to add not only to the strength and 
fighting powers of the males, but likewise to their 
various ornaments or other attractions. 

In the converse and much rarer case of the males 
selecting particular females, it is plain that those 
which were the most vigorous and had conquered 
others, would have the freest choice ; and it is almost 
certain that they would select vigorous as well as 
attractive females. Such pairs would have an advan- 
tage in rearing offspring, more especially if the male 
had the power to defend the female during the pairing- 
season as occurs with some of the higher animals, or 
aided her in providing for the young. The same 
principles would apply if each sex preferred and 
selected certain individuals of the opposite sex ; sup- 
posing that they selected not only the more attractive, 
but likewise the more vigorous individuals. 

Numerical Proportion of the Two Sexes . — I have 
remarked that sexual selection would be a simple affair 
if the males were considerably more numerous than 
the females. Hence I was led to investigate, as far as 
I could, the proportions between the two sexes of as 
many animals as possible ; but the materials are scanty. 
I will here give only a brief abstract of the results, 
retaining the details for a supplementary discussion, 
so as not to interfere with the course of my argument. 
Domesticated animals alone afford the means of 
ascertaining the proportional numbers at birth; but 
no records have been specially kept for this purpose. 
By indirect means, however, I have collected a con- 
siderable body of statistics, from which it appears that 


332 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part II. 


with most of our domestic animals the sexes are nearly 
equal at birth. Thus 25,560 births of race-horses 
have been recorded during twenty-one years, and the 
male births were to the female births as 99*7 to 100. 
In greyhounds the inequality is greater than with any 
other animal, for out of 6878 births during twelve 
years, the male births were to the female as HOT to 
1 00. It is, however, in some degree doubtful whether 
it is safe to infer that the proportion would be the 
same under natural conditions as under domestication ; 
for slight and unknown differences in the conditions 
affect the proportion of the sexes. Thus with man- 
kind, the male births in England are as 104*5, in 
Eussia as 108*9, and with the Jews of Livonia as 120, 
to lUO female births. But I shall recur to this curious 
point of the excess of male births in the supplement to 
this chapter. At the Cape of Good Hope, however, 
male children of European extraction have been born 
during several years in the proportion of between 90 
and 99 to 100 female children. 

For our present purpose we are concerned with the 
proportion of the sexes, not only at birth, but also at 
maturity, and this adds another element of doubt ; for 
it is a well-ascertained fact that with man the number 
of males dying before or during birth, and during the 
first few years of infancy, is considerably larger than 
that of females. So it almost certainly is with male 
lambs, and probably with some other animals. The 
males of some species kill one another by fighting ; or 
they drive one another about until they become greatly 
emaciated. They must also be often exposed to various 
dangers, whilst wandering about in eager search for 
the females. In many kinds of fish the males are much 


Chap. VIII.

smaller than the females, and they are believed often 
to be devoured by the latter, or by other fishes. The 
females of some birds appear to die earlier than the 
males ; they are also liable to be destroyed on their 
nests, or whilst in charge of their young. With 
insects the female larvae are often larger than those of 
the males, and would consequently be more likely to 
be devoured. In some cases the mature females are 
less active and less rapid in their movements than the 
males, and could not escape so well from danger. 
Hence, with animals in a state of nature, we must rely 
on mere estimation, in order to judge of the propor- 
tions of the sexes at maturity ; and this is but little 
trustworthy, except when the inequality is strongly 
marked. Nevertheless, as far as a judgment can be 
formed, we may conclude from the facts given in the 
supplement, that the males of some few mammals, of 
many birds, of some fish and insects, are considerably 
more numerous than the females. 

The proportion between the sexes fluctuates slightly 
during successive years : thus with race-horses, for 
every 100 mares born the stallions varied from 107*1 
in one year to 92*6 in another year, and with grey- 
hounds from 116'3 to 95*3. But had larger numbers 
been tabulated throughout an area more extensive than 
England, these fluctuations would probably have dis- 
appeared; and such as they are, would hardly suffice 
to lead to effective sexual selection in a state of nature. 
Nevertheless, in the cases of some few wild animals, as 
shewn in the supplement, the proportions seem to 
fluctuate either during different seasons or in different 
localities in a sufficient degree to lead to such selection. 
For it should be observed that any advantage, gained

during certain years or in certain localities by those 
males which were able to conquer their rivals, or were 
the most attractive to the females, would probably be 
transmitted to the offspring, and would not subse- 
quently be eliminated. During the succeeding seasons, 
when, from the equality of the sexes, every male was 
able to procure a female, the stronger or more at- 
tractive males previously produced would still have at 
least as good a chance of leaving offspring as the 
weaker or less attractive. 

Polygamy . — The practice of polygamy leads to the 
same results as would follow from an actual inequality 
in the number of the sexes ; for if each male secures 
two or more females, many males cannot pair ; and the 
latter assuredly will be the weaker or less attractive 
individuals. Many mammals and some few birds are 
polygamous, but with animals belonging to the lower 
classes I have found no evidence of this habit. The 
intellectual powers of such animals are, perhaps, not 
sufficient to lead them to collect and guard a harem of 
females. That some relation exists between polygamy 
and the development of secondary sexual characters, 
appears nearly certain ; and this supports the view 
that a numerical preponderance of males would be 
eminently favourable to the action of sexual selection. 
Nevertheless many animals, which are strictly mono- 
gamous, especially birds, display strongly-marked 
secondary sexual characters ; whilst some few animals, 
which are polygamous, do not have such characters. 

We will first briefly run through the mammals, and 
then turn to birds. The gorilla seems to be poly- 
gamous, and the male differs considerably from the

female ; so it is with some baboons, which live in herds 
containing twice as many adult females as males. In 
South America the Mycetes caraya presents well-marked 
sexual differences, in colour, heard, and vocal organs ; 
and the male generally lives with two or three wives : 
the male of the Gebus capucinus differs somewhat from 
the female, and appears to he polygamous.^® Little 
is known on this head with respect to most other 
monkeys, but some species are strictly monogamous. 
The ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they 
present sexual differences more frequently than almost 
any other group of mammals ; this holds good, especially 
in their weapons, but also in other characters. Most 
deer, cattle, and sheep are polygamous ; as are most 
antelopes, though some are monogamous. Sir Andrew 
Smith, in speaking of the antelopes of South Africa, 
says that in herds of about a dozen there was rarely 
more than one mature male. The Asiatic Antilope 
miga appears to be the most inordinate polygamist in 
the world ; for Pallas states that the male drives 
away all rivals, and collects a herd of about a hundred 
females and kids together ; the female is hornless and 
has softer hair, but does not otherwise differ much from 
the male. The wild horse of the Falkland Islands and 
of the Western States of N. America is polygamous.

but, except in his greater size and in the proportions 
of his body, differs but little from the mare. The wild 
boar presents well-marked sexual characters, in his 
great tusks and some other points. In Europe and in 
India he leads a solitary life, except during the breed- 
ing-season ; but as is believed by Sir W. Elliot, who 
has had many opportunities in India of observing this 
animal, he consorts at this season with several females. 
Whether this holds good in Europe is doubtful, but it 
is supported by some evidence. The adult male Indian 
elephant, like the boar, passes much of his time in soli- 
tude ; but as Dr. Campbell states, when with others, 
“ it is rare to find more than one male with a whole 
“ herd of females ; ” the larger males expelling or 
killing the smaller and weaker ones. The male differs 
from the female in his immense tusks, greater size, 
strength, and endurance ; so great is the difference in 
these respects, that the males when caught are valued 
at one-fifth more than the females.^^ The sexes of 
other pachydermatous animals differ very little or not 
at all, and, as far as known, they are not polygamists. 
Nor have I heard of any species in the Orders of 
Cheiroptera, Edentata, Insectivora and Eodents being 
polygamous, excepting that amongst the Eodents, the 
common rat, according to some rat-catchers, lives with 
several females. Nevertheless the two sexes of some 
sloths (Edentata) differ in the character and colour of 
certain patches of hair on their shoulders. And 
many kinds of bats (Cheiroptera) present well-marked 
sexual differences, chiefly in the males possessing

odoriferous glands and pouches, and by their being of a 
lighter colour.^^ In the great order of Eodents, as far 
as I can learn, the sexes rarely differ, and when they 
do so, it is but slightly in the tint of the fur. 

As I hear from Sir Andrew Smith, the lion in South 
Africa sometimes lives with a single female, hut 
generally with more, and, in one case, was found with 
as many as five females ; so that he is polygamous. 
As far as I can discover, he is the only polygamist 
amongst all the terrestrial Carnivora, and he alone 
presents well-marked sexual characters. If, however, 
we turn to the marine Carnivora, as we shall hereafter 
see, the case is widely different ; for many species of 
seals offer extraordinary sexual differences, and they 
are eminently polygamous. Thus, according to Peron, 
the male sea-elephant of the Southern Ocean always 
possesses several females, and the sea-lion of Forster is 
said to he surrounded by from twenty to thirty females. 
In the North, the male sea-bear of Steller is accom- 
panied by even a greater number of females. It is an 
interesting fact, as Dr. Oill remarks,^® that in the 
monogamous species, “ or those living in small com- 
‘‘ munities, there is little difference in size between the 
“ males and females ; in the social species, or rather 

those of which the males have harems, the males are 
“ vastly larger than the females.” 

Amongst birds, many species, the sexes of which 
differ greatly from each other, are certainly monoga- 
mous. In great Britain we see well-marked sexual 
differences, for instance, in the wild-duck which pairs

with a single female, the common blackbird, and the 
bullfinch which is said to pair for life. I am informed 
by Mr. Wallace that the like is true of the Chatterers 
, or Ootingidae of South America, and of many other 
birds. In several groups I have not been able to 
discover whether the species are polygamous or mono- 
gamous. Lesson says that birds of paradise, so re- 
markable for their sexual differences, are polygamous, 
but Mr. Wallace doubts whether he had sufficient 
evidence. Mr. Salvin tells me he has been led to 
believe that humming-birds are polygamous. The 
male widow-bird, remarkable for his caudal plumes, 
certainly seems to be a polygamist.^® I have been 
assured by Mr. Jenner Weir and by others, that it is 
somewhat common for three starlings to frequent the 
same nest ; but whether this is a case of polygamy or 
polyandry has not been ascertained. 

The Gallinaceae exhibit almost as strongly marked 
sexual differences as birds of paradise or humming- 
birds, and many of the species are, as is well known, 
polygamous ; others being strictly monogamous. 
What a contrast is presented between the sexes of the 
polygamous peacock or pheasant, and the monogamous 
guinea-fowl or partridge ! Many similar cases could 
be given, as in the grouse tribe, in which the males of 
the polygamous capercailzie and black-cock differ 
greatly from the females ; whilst the sexes of the 
monogamous red grouse and ptarmigan differ very

little. In the Cursores, except amongst the bustards, 
few species offer strongly-marked sexual differences, 
and the great bustard (Otis tarda) is said to be poly- 
gamous. With the Grallatores, extremely few species 
differ sexually, but the ruff (Machetes pugnax) affords a 
marked exception, and this species is believed by 
Montagu to he a polygamist. Hence it appears that 
amongst birds there often exists a close relation 
between polygamy and the development of strongly- 
marked sexual differences. I asked Mr. Bartlett, of 
the Zoological Gardens, who has had very large ex- 
perience with birds, whether the male tragopan (one of 
the Gallinaceae) was polygamous, and I was struck by 
his answering, “ I do not know, but should think so 
“ from his splendid colours.” 

It deserves notice that the instinct of pairing with a 
single female is easily lost under domestication. The 
wild-duck is strictly monogamous, the domestic-duck 
highly polygamous. The Eev. W. D. Fox informs me 
that out of some half-tamed wild-ducks, on a large 
pond in his neighbourhood, so many mallards were 
shot by the gamekeeper that only one was left for 
every seven or eight females ; yet unusually large 
broods were reared. The guinea-fowl is strictly 
monogamous ; but Mr. Fox finds that his birds succeed 
best when he keeps one cock to two or three hens. 
Canary-birds pair in a state of nature, but the breeders 
in England successfully put one male to four or five 
females. I have noticed these cases, as rendering it 
probable that wild monogamous species might readily 
become either temporarily or permanently polygamous. 

Too little is known of the habits of reptiles and 
fishes to enable us to speak of their marriage arrange-

ments. The s tickle-back (Gasterosteus), however, is 
said to be a polygamist ; and the male during the 
breeding season differs conspicuously from the female. 

To sum up on the means through which, as far as 
we can judge, sexual selection has led to the deve- 
lopment of secondary sexual characters. It has been 
shewn that the largest number of vigorous offspring 
will be reared from the pairing of the strongest and 
best-armed males, victorious in contests over other 
males, with the most vigorous and best-nourished 
females, which are the first to breed in the spring. If 
such females select the more attractive, and at the 
same time vigorous males, they will rear a larger 
number of offspring than the retarded females, which 
must pair with the less vigorous and less attractive 
males. So it will be if the more vigorous males select 
the more attractive and at the same time healthy and 
vigorous females ; and this will especially hold good if 
the male defends the female, and aids in providing food 
for the young. The advantage thus gained by the 
more vigorous pairs in rearing a larger number of 
offspring has apparently sufficed to render sexual 
selection efficient. But a large numerical prepon- 
derance of males over females will be still more 
efficient ; whether the preponderance is only occasional 
and local, or permanent ; whether it occurs at birth, or 
afterwards from the greater destruction of the females ; 
or whether it indirectly follows from the practice of 
polygamy. 

The Male generally more modified than the Female . —

in external appearance, it is, with rare exceptions, the 
male which has been the more modified ; for, generally, 
the female retains a closer resemblance to the young of 
her own species, and to other adult members of the 
game group. The cause of this seems to lie in the 
males of almost all animals having stronger passions 
than the females. Hence it is the males that fight 
together and sedulously display their charms before 
the females ; and the victors transmit their superiority 
to their male offspring. Why both sexes do not thus 
acquire the characters of their fathers, will be con- 
sidered hereafter. That the males of all mammals 
eagerly pursue the females is notorious to every one. 
So it is with birds ; but many cock birds do not so 
much pursue the hen, as display their plumage, per- 
form strange antics, and pour forth their song in her 
presence. The male in the few fish observed seems 
much more eager than the female ; and the same is 
true of alligators, and apparently of Batrachians. 
Throughout the enormous class of insects, as Kirby 
remarks,^® “ the law is, that the male shall seek the 
“female.” Two good authorities, Mr. Blackwall and 
Mr. C. Spence Bate, tell me that the males of spiders 
and crustaceans are more active and more erratic in 
their habits than the females. When the organs of 
sense or locomotion are present in the one sex of insects 
and crustaceans and absent in the other, or when, as is 
frequently the case, they are more highly developed in 
the one than in the other, it is, as far as I can discover, 
almost invariably the male which retains such organs, 
or has them most developed ; and this shews that the

Part II. 


male is the more active member in the courtship of the 
sexes. 

The female, on the other hand, with the rarest 
exceptions, is less eager than the male. As the illus- 
trious Hunter^® long ago observed, she generally 
“ requires to be courted ; ” she is coy, and may often 
be seen endeavouring for a long time to escape from 
the male. Every observer of the habits of animals will 
be able to call to mind instances of this kind. It is 
shown by various facts, given hereafter, and by the 
results fairly attributable to sexual selection, that the 
female, though comparatively passive, generally exerts 
some choice and accepts one male in preference to 
others. Or she may accept, as appearances would 
sometimes lead us to believe, not the male which is the 
most attractive to her, but the one which is the least 
distasteful. The exertion of some choice on the part of 
the female seems a law almost as general as the 
eagerness of the male. 

We are naturally led to enquire why the male, in so 
many and such distinct classes, has become more eager 
than the female, so that he searches for her, and plays 
the more active part in courtship. It would be no 
advantage and some loss of power if each sex searched 


One parasitic Hymenopter- 
ous insect (Westwood, ‘Modern 
Class, of Insects,’ vol. ii. p. 160) 
forms an exception to the rule, 
as the male has rudimentary 
wings, and never quits the cell 
in which it is horn, whilst the 
female has well-developed wings. 
Audouin believes that the fe- 
males of this species are impreg- 
nated by the males which are 
born in the same cells with 


them ; but it is much more 
probable that the females visit 
other cells, so that close inter- 
breeding is thus avoided. We 
shall hereafter meet in various 
classes, with a few exceptional 
cases, in which the female, 
instead of the male, is the seeker 
and wooer.

edited by Owen, vol. i. 1861, p.

343 


for the other; but why should the male almost always 
be the seeker ? The ovules of plants after fertilisation 
have to be nourished for a time ; hence the pollen is 
necessarily brought to the female organs — being placed 
on the stigma, by means of insects or the wind, or by 
the spontaneous movements of the stamens ; and in 
the Algae, &c., by the locomotive power of the anthero- 
zooids. With lowly-organised aquatic animals, per- 
manently affixed to the same spot and having their 
sexes separate, the male element is invariably brought 
to the female ; and of this we can see the reason, for 
even if the ova were detached before fertilisation, and 
did not require subsequent nourishment or protection, 
there would yet be greater difficulty in transporting 
them than the male element, because, being larger than 
the latter, they are produced in far smaller numbers. 
So that many of the lower animals are, in this 
respect, analogous with plants.^^ The males of affixed 
and aquatic animals having been led to emit their 
fertilising element in this way, it is natural that any 
of their descendants, which rose in the scale and 
became locomotive, should retain the same habit ; and 
they would approach the female as closely as possible, 
in order not to risk the loss of the fertilising element 
in a long passage of it through the water. With some 
few of the lower animals, the females alone are fixed, 
and the males of these must be the seekers. But it is 
difficult to understand why the males of species, of 
which the progenitors were primordially iree, should 
invariably have acquired the habit of approaching the

females, instead of being approached by them. But in 
all cases, in order that the males should seek efficiently, 
it would be necessary that they should be endowed 
with strong passions ; and the acquirement of such 
' passions would naturally follow from the more eager 
leaving a larger number of offspring than the less 
eager. 

The great eagerness of the males has thus indirectly 
led to their much more frequently developing secondary 
sexual characters than the females. But the develop- 
ment of such characters would be much aided, if the 
males were more liable to vary than the females — as I 
concluded they were — after a long study of domesti- 
cated animals. Von Nathusius, who has had very wide 
experience, is strongly of the same opinion. Grood 
evidence also in favour of this conclusion can be 
produced by a comparison of the two sexes in mankind. 
During the Novara Expeditions^ a vast number of 
measurements was made of various parts of the body 
in different races, and the men were found in almost 
every case to present a greater range of variation than 
the women; but I shall have to recur to this subject in 
a future chapter. Mr. J. Wood,^^ who has carefully 
attended to the variation of the muscles in man, puts 
in italics the conclusion that “ the greatest number of 
“abnormalities in each subject is found in the males.” 
He had previously remarked that “ altogether in 102

“subjects, the varieties of redundancy were found to 
“be half as many again as in females, contrasting 
“ widely with the greater frequency of deficiency in 
“ females before described.” Professor Macalister like- 
wise remarks that variations in the muscles “ are 
“ probably more common in males than females.” 
Certain muscles which are not normally present in 
mankind are also more frequently developed in the 
male than in the female sex, although exceptions to 
this rule are said to occur. Dr. Burt Wilder^® has 
tabulated the cases of 152 individuals with supernu- 
merary digits, of which 86 were males, and 39, or less 
than half, females, the remaining 27 being of unknown 
sex. It should not, however, be overlooked that women 
would more frequently endeavour to conceal a deformity 
of this kind than men. Again, Dr. L. Meyer asserts 
that the ears of man are more variable in form than 
those of a woman.^^ Lastly the temperature is more 
variable in man than in woman.^® 

The cause of the greater general variability in the 
male sex, than in the female is unknown, except in so 
far as secondary sexual characters are extraordinarily 
variable, and are usually confined to the males ; and, as 
we shall presently see, this fact is, to a certain extent, 
intelligible. Through the action of sexual and natural 
selection male animals have been rendered in very 
many instances widely diflferent from their females; 
but independently of selection the two sexes, from

differing constitutionally, tend to vary in a somewhat 
different manner. The female has to expend much 
organic matter in the formation of her ova, whereas 
the male expends much force in fierce contests with 
' his rivals, in wandering about in search of the female, 
in exerting his voice, pouring out odoriferous secre- 
tions, &c. : and this expenditure is generally concen- 
trated within a short period. The great vigour of the 
male during the season of love seems often to intensify 
his colours, independently of any marked difference 
from the female.^® In mankind, and even as low down 
in the organic scale as in the Lepidoptera, the tem- 
perature of the body is higher in the male than in the 
female, accompanied in the case of man by a slower 
pulse.^® On the whole the expenditure of matter and 
force by the two sexes is probably nearly equal, 
though effected in very different ways and at different 
fates. 

From the causes just specified the two sexes can 
hardly fail to differ somewhat in constitution, at least 
during the breeding season ; and, although they may 
be subjected to exactly the same conditions, they will 
tend to vary in a different manner. If such variations 
are of no service to either sex, they will not be accu- 
mulated and increased by sexual or natural selection. 


^ Prof. Mantegazza is in- 
clined to believe (‘ Lettera a 
Carlo Darwin,’ ‘ Arcbivio per 
I’Anthropologia,’ 1871, p. 306) 
that the bright colours, common 
in so many male animals, are 
due to the presence and reten- 
tion by them of the spermatic 
fluid ; but this can hardly be 
the case ; for many male birds, 
for instance young pheasants, 


become brightly coloured in the 
autumn of their first year. 

For mankind, see Dr. J. 
Stockton Hough, whose con- 
clusions are given in the ‘ Pop. 
Science Keview,’ 1874, p. 97.

Lepidoptera, as given in the 
‘ Zoological Record,’ 1869, p.

347 


Nevertheless, they may become permanent if the 
exciting cause acts permanently ; and in accordance 
with a frequent form of inheritance they may he 
transmitted to that sex alone in which they first 
appeared. In this case the two sexes will come to 
present permanent, yet unimportant, differences of 
character. For instance, Mr. Allen shews that with a 
large number of birds inhabiting the northern and 
southern United States, the specimens from the south 
are darker-coloured than those from the north ; and 
this seems to be the direct result of the difference in 
temperature, light, &c., between the two regions. Now, 
in some few cases, the two sexes of the same species 
appear to have been differently affected ; in the Agelseus 
phoeniceus the males have had their colours greatly 
intensified in the south ; whereas with Cardinalis 
virginianus it is the females which have been thus 
affected ; with Quiscalus major the females have been 
rendered extremely variable in tint, whilst the males 
remain nearly uniform.^^ 

A few exceptional cases occur in various classes of 
animals, in which the females instead of the males have 
acquired well pronounced secondary sexual characters, 
such as brighter colours, greater size, strength, or 
pugnacity. With birds there has sometimes been a 
complete transposition of the ordinary characters 
proper to each sex ; the females having become the 
more eager in courtship, the males remaining com- 
paratively passive, but apparently selecting the more 
attractive females, as we may infer from the results. 
Certain hen birds have thus been rendered more highly 
coloured or otherwise ornamented, as well as more

powerful and pugnacious than the cocks ; these charac- 
ters being transmitted to the female offspring alone. 

It may he suggested that in some cases a double 
process of selection has been carried on ; that the 
'males have selected the more attractive females, and 
the latter the more attractive males. This process, 
however, though it might lead to the modification of 
both sexes, would not make the one sex different from 
the other, unless indeed their tastes for the beautiful 
differed ; but this is a supposition too improbable to 
be worth considering in the case of any animal, 
excepting man. There are, however, many animals in 
which the sexes resemble each other, both being 
furnished with the same ornaments, which analogy 
would lead us to attribute to the agency of sexual 
selection. In such cases it may be suggested with 
more plausibility, that there has been a double or 
mutual process of sexual selection ; the more vigorous 
and precocious females selecting the more attractive 
and vigorous males, the latter rejecting all except the 
more attractive females. But from what we know of 
the habits of animals, this view is hardly probable, for 
the male is generally eager to pair with any female. 
It is more probable that the ornaments common to 
both sexes were acquired by one sex, generally the 
male, and then transmitted to the offspring of both 
sexes. If, indeed, during a lengthened period the 
males of any species were greatly to exceed the females 
in number, and then during another lengthened period, 
but under different conditions, the reverse were to 
occur, a double, but not simultaneous, process of sexual 
selection might easily be carried on, by which the two 
sexes might be rendered widely different. 


Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


349 


We shall hereafter see that many animals exist, of 
which neither sex is brilliantly coloured or provided 
with special ornaments, and yet the members of both 
sexes or of one alone have probably acquired simple 
colours, such as white or black, through sexual 
selection. The absence of bright tints or other orna- 
ments may be the result of variations of the right kind 
never having occurred, or of the animals themselves 
having preferred plain black or white. Obscure tints 
have often been developed through natural selection 
for the sake of protection, and the acquirement through 
sexual selection of conspicuous colours, appears to have 
been sometimes checked from the danger thus incurred. 
But in other cases the males during long ages may 
have struggled together for the possession of the 
females, and yet no effect will have been produced, 
unless a larger number of offspring were left by the 
more successful males to inherit their superiority, than 
by the less successful : and this, as previously shewn, 
depends on many complex contingencies. 

Sexual selection acts in a less rigorous manner than 
natural selection. The latter produces its effects by 
the life or death at all ages of the more or less success- 
ful individuals. Death, indeed, not rarely ensues from 
the conflicts of rival males. But generally the less 
successful male merely fails to obtain a female, or 
obtains a retarded and less vigorous female later in the 
season, or, if polygamous, obtains fewer females; so 
that they leave fewer, less vigorous, or no offspring. 
In regard to structures acquired through ordinary or 
natural selection, there is in most cases, as long as 
the conditions of life remain the same, a limit to the 
amount of advantageous modification in relation to 


350 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part II. 


certain special purposes ; but in regard to structures 
adapted to make one male victorious over another, 
either in fighting or in charming the female, there is 
no definite limit to the amount of advantageous 
modification ; so that as long as the proper variations 
arise the work of sexual selection will go on. This 
circumstance may partly account for the frequent and 
extraordinary amount of variability presented by 
secondary sexual characters. Nevertheless, natural 
selection will determine that such characters shall not 
be acquired by the victorious males, if they would be 
highly injurious, either by expending too much of their 
vital powers, or by exposing them to any great danger. 
The development, however, of certain structures — of 
the horns, for instance, in certain stags — has been 
carried to a wonderful extreme ; and in some cases to 
an extreme which, as far as the general conditions of 
life are concerned, must be slightly injurious to the 
male. From this fact we learn that the advantages 
which favoured males derive from conquering other 
males in battle or courtship, and thus leaving a 
numerous progeny, are in the long run greater than 
those derived from rather more perfect adaptation to 
their conditions of life. We shall further see, and it 
could never have been anticipated, that the power to 
charm the female has sometimes been more important 
than the power to conquer other males in battle. 


I.AWS OF INHERITANCE. 

In order to understand how sexual selection has 
acted on many animals of many classes, and in the 
course of ages has produced a conspicuous result, it is 


Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


351 


necessary to bear in mind the laws of inheritance, as 
far as they are known. Two distinct elements are 
included under the term “ inheritance ” — the trans- 
mission, and the development of characters; but as 
these generally go together, the distinction is often 
overlooked. We see this distinction in those characters 
which are transmitted through the early years of life, 
but are developed only at maturity or during old age. 
We see the same distinction more clearly with secon- 
dary sexual characters, for these are transmitted through 
both sexes, though developed in one alone. That they 
are present in both sexes, is manifest when two species, 
having strongly-marked sexual characters, are crossed, 
for each transmits the characters proper to its own 
male and female sex to the hybrid offspring of either 
sex. The same fact is likewise manifest, when 
characters proper to the male are occasionally deve- 
loped in the female when she grows old or becomes 
diseased, as, for instance, when the common hen 
assumes the flowing tail-feathers, hackles, comb, spurs, 
voice, and even pugnacity of the cock. Conversely, the 
same thing is evident, more or less plainly, with cas- 
trated males. Again, independently of old age or 
disease, characters are occasionally transferred from 
the male to the female, as when, in certain breeds of 
the fowl, spurs regularly appear in the young and 
healthy females. But in truth they are simply deve- 
loped in the female ; for in every breed each detail in 
the structure of the spur is transmitted through the 
female to her male offspring. Many cases will here- 
after be given, where the female exhibits, more or less 
perfectly, characters proper to the male, in whom they 
must have been first developed, and then transferred 


352 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part H 


to the female. The converse case of the first develop- 
ment of characters in the female and of transference 
to the male, is less frequent ; it will therefore be well 
, to give one striking instance. With bees the pollen- 
collecting apparatus is used by the female alone for 
gathering pollen for the larvae, yet in most of the 
species it is partially developed in the males to whom 
it is quite useless, and it is perfectly developed in the 
males of Bombus or the humble-bee.^^ As not a single 
other Hymenopterous insect, not even the wasp, which 
is closely allied to the bee, is provided with a pollen- 
collecting apparatus, we have no grounds for supposing 
that male bees primordially collected pollen as well as 
the females ; although we have some reason to suspect 
that male mammals primordially suckled their young 
as well as the females. Lastly, in all cases of reversion, 
characters are transmitted through two, three, or 
many more generations, and are then developed under 
certain unknown favourable conditions. This im- 
portant distinction between transmission and develop- 
ment will be best kept in mind by the aid of the 
hypothesis of pangenesis. According to this hypothesis, 
every unit or cell of the body throws off gemmules or 
undeveloped atoms, which are transmitted to the off- 
spring of both sexes, and are multiplied by self-division. 
Tney may remain undeveloped during the early years 
of life or during successive generations ; and their 
development into units or cells, like those from which 
they were derived, depends on their affinity for, and 
union with other units or cells previously developed in 
the due order of growth.

SEXUAL SELECTION. 


353 


Inheritance at corresponding Periods of Life . — This 
tendency is well established. A new character, ap- 
pearing in a young animal, whether it lasts through- 
out life or is only transient, will, in general, reappear 
in the offspring at the same age and last for the same 
time. If, on the other hand, a new character appears 
at maturity, or even during old age, it tends to re- 
appear in the offspring at the same advanced age. 
When deviations from this rule occur, the transmitted 
characters much oftener appear before, than after the 
corresponding age. As I have dwelt on this subject 
sufficiently in another work,^® I will here merely give 
two or three instances, for the sake of recalling the 
subject to the reader’s mind. In several breeds of the 
Fowl, the down-covered chickens, the young birds in 
their first true plumage, and the adults differ greatly 
from one another, as well as from their common parent- 
form, the Gallus hanJciva; and these characters are 
faithfully transmitted by each breed to their offspring 
at the corresponding periods of life. For instance, the 
chickens of spangled Hamburgs, whilst covered with 
down, have a few dark spots on the head and rump, but 
are not striped longitudinally, as in many other 
breeds ; in their first true plumage, “ they are beauti- 
fully pencilled,” that is each feather is transversely 
marked by numerous dark bars ; but in their second 
plumage the feathers all become spangled or tipped 
with a dark round spot.^^ Hence in this breed

variations have occurred at, and been transmitted to, 
three distinct periods of life. The Pigeon offers a 
more remarkable case, because the aboriginal parent 
species does not undergo any change of plumage with 
advancing age, excepting that at maturity the breast 
becomes more iridescent ; yet there are breeds which 
do not acquire their characteristic colours until they 
have moulted two, three, or four times ; and these 
modifications of plumage are regularly transmitted. 

Inheritance at corres]ponding Seasons of the Year . — 
With animals in a state of nature, innumerable in- 
stances occur of characters appearing periodically at 
different seasons. We see this in the horns of the 
stag, and in the fur of arctic animals which becomes 
thick and white during the winter. Many birds 
acquire bright colours and other decorations during 
the breeding-season alone. Pallas states,^® that in 
Siberia domestic cattle and horses become lighter- 
coloured during the winter; and I have myself ob- 
served, and heard of similar strongly marked changes 
of colour, that is, from brownish cream-colour or 
reddish-brown to a perfect white, in several ponies in 
England. Although I do not know that this tendency 
to change the colour of the coat during different seasons 
is transmitted, yet it probably is so, as all shades of 
colour are strongly inherited by the horse. Nor is

this form of inheritance, as limited by the seasons, 
more remarkable than its limitation by age or sex. 

Inheritance as Limited hy Sex . — The eqnal trans- 
mission of characters to both sexes is the commonest 
form of inheritance, at least with those animals which 
do not present strongly-marked sexual differences, and 
indeed with many of these. But characters are some- 
what commonly transferred exclusively to that sex, in 
which they first appear. Ample evidence on this head 
has been advanced in my work on ‘ Variation under 
Domestication,’ but a few instances may here be given. 
There are breeds of the sheep and goat, in which the 
horns of the male differ greatly in shape from those of 
the female ; and these differences, acquired under 
domestication, are regularly transmitted to the same 
sex. As a rule, it is the females alone in cats which 
are tortoise-shell, the corresponding colour in the males 
being rusty-red. With most breeds of the fowl, the 
characters proper to each sex are transmitted to the 
same sex alone. So general is this form of transmis- 
sion that it is an anomaly when variations in certain 
breeds are transmitted equally to both sexes. There 
are also certain sub-breeds of the fowl in which the 
males can hardly be distinguished from one another, 
whilst the females differ considerably in colour. The 
sexes of the pigeon in the parent-species do not differ 
in any external character; nevertheless, in certain 
domesticated breeds the male is coloured differently 
from the female.®® The wattle in the English Carrier

pigeon, and the crop in the Pouter, are more highly 
developed in the male than in the female; and al- 
though these characters have been gained through 
long-continued selection by man, the slight dijSferences 
between the sexes are wholly due to the form of 
inheritance which has prevailed ; for they have arisen, 
not from, but rather in opposition to, the wish of the 
breeder. 

Most of our domestic races have been formed by the 
accumulation of many slight variations ; and as some 
of the successive steps have been transmitted to one 
sex alone, and some to both sexes, we find in the 
different breeds of the same species all gradations 
between great sexual dissimilarity and complete simi- 
larity. Instances have already been given with the 
breeds of the fowl and pigeon, and under nature 
analogous cases are common. With animals under 
domestication, but whether in nature I will not venture 
to say, one sex may lose characters proper to it, and 
may thus come somewhat to resemble the opposite 
sex ; for instance, the males of some breeds of the fowl 
have lost their masculine tail-plumes and hackles. 
On the other hand, the differences between the sexes 
may be increased under domestication, as with merino 
sheep, in which the ewes have lost their horns. Again, 
characters proper to one sex may suddenly appear in 
the other sex ; as in those sub-breeds of the fowl in 
which the hens acquire spurs whilst young ; or, as in 
certain Polish sub-breeds, in which the females, as 
there is reason to believe, originally acquired a crest, 
and subsequently transferred it to the males. All 
these cases are intelligible on the hypothesis of pan- 
genesis ; for they depend on the gemmules of certain 


Chap. VIII.

357 


parts, although present in both sexes, becoming, 
through the influence of domestication, either dormant 
or developed in either sex. 

There is one difficult question which it will be 
convenient to defer to a future chapter; namely, 
whether a character at first developed in both sexes, 
fould through selection be limited in its development 
to one sex alone. If, for instance, a breeder observed 
that some of his pigeons (of which the characters are 
usually transferred in an equal degree to both sexes) 
varied into pale blue, could he by long-continued 
selection make a breed, in which the males alone should 
be of this tint, whilst the females remained unchanged ? 
I will here only say, that this, though perhaps not 
impossible, would be extremely difficult ; for the 
natural result of breeding from the pale-blue males 
would be to change the whole stock of both sexes to 
this tint. If, however, variations of the desired tint 
appeared, which were from the first limited in their 
development to the male sex, there would not be the 
least difficulty in making a breed with the two sexes 
of a different colour, as indeed has been effected with 
a Belgian breed, in which the males alone are streaked 
with black. In a similar manner, if any variation 
appeared in a female pigeon, which was from the first 
sexually limited in its development to the females, it 
would be easy to make a breed with the females alone 
thus characterised ; but if the variation was not thus 
originally limited, the process would be extremely 
difficult, perhaps impossible.*’

On the Belation between the Period of Development of 
a Character and its Transmission to one Sex or to both 
Sexes, — Why certain characters should be inherited by 
both sexes, and other characters by one sex alone, 

. namely by that sex in which the character first 
appeared, is in most cases quite unknown. We cannot 
even conjecture why with certain sub-breeds of the 
pigeon, black striae, though transmitted through the 
female, should be developed in the male alone, whilst 
every other character is equally transferred to both 
sexes. Why, again, with cats, the tortoise-shell colour 
should, with rare exceptions, be developed in the 
female alone. The very same character, such as 
deficient or supernumerary digits, colour-blindness, 
&c., may with mankind be inherited by the males 
alone of one family, and in another family by the 
females alone, though in both cases transmitted through 
the opposite as well as through the same sex.®® Al- 
though we are thus ignorant, the two following rules 
seem often to hold good — that variations which first 
appear in either sex at a late period of life, tend to be 
developed in the same sex alone; whilst variations 
which first appear early in life in either sex tend to be 
developed in both sexes. I am, however, far from 
supposing that this is the sole determining cause. As 


of the transmission of colour by 
one sex alone, and the forma- 
tion of a sub-breed with this 
character, he says: “It is a 
“ singular circumstance that Mr. 
“ Darwin should hare suggested 
“the possibility of modifying 
“ the sexual colour! of birds by 
“ a course of artificial selection. 


“ When he did so, he was in 
“ ignorance of these facts that I 
“ have related ; but it is remark- 
able how very closely he sug- 
“gested the right method of 
“ procedure.”

Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


859 


I have not elsewhere discussed this subject, and as it 
has an important bearing on sexual selection, I must 
here enter into lengthy and somewhat intricate 
details. 

It is in itself probable that any character appearing 
at an early age would tend to be inherited equally by 
both sexes, for the sexes do not differ much in consti- 
tution before the power of reproduction is gained. On 
the other hand, after this power has been gained and 
the sexes have come to differ in constitution, the 
gemmules (if I may again use the language of pan- 
genesis) which are cast off from each varying part in 
the one sex would be much more likely to possess the 
proper affinities for uniting with the tissues of the 
same sex, and thus becoming developed, than with 
those of the opposite sex. 

I was first led to infer that a relation of this kind 
exists, from the fact that whenever and in whatever 
manner the adult male differs from the adult female, 
he differs in the same manner from the young of both 
sexes. The generality of this fact is quite remarkable : 
it holds good with almost all mammals, birds, amphi- 
bians, and fishes ; also with many crustaceans, spiders, 
and some few insects, such as certain orthoptera and 
libellulsB. In all these cases the variations, through 
the accumulation of which the male acquired his proper 
masculine characters, must have occurred at a some- 
what late period of life ; otherwise the young males 
would have been similarly characterised; and con- 
formably with our rule, the variations are transmitted 
to and developed in the adult males alone. When, on 
the other hand, the adult male closely resembles the 
young of both sexes (these, with rare exceptions, being 


360 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Part IL 


alike), he generally resembles the adult female ; and in 
most of these cases the variations through which the 
young and old acquired their present characters, 
probably occurred, according to our rule, during youth. 
But there is here room for doubt, for characters are 
sometimes transferred to the offspring at an earlier 
age than that at which they first appeared in the 
parents, so that the parents may have varied when 
adult, and have transferred their characters to their 
offspring whilst young. There are, moreover, many 
animals, in which the two sexes closely resemble each 
other, and yet both differ from their young ; and here 
the characters of the adults must have been acquired 
late in life ; nevertheless, these characters, in apparent 
contradiction to our rule, are transferred to both sexes. 
We must not, however, overlook the possibility of even 
probability of successive variations of the same nature 
occurring, under exposure to similar conditions, simul- 
taneously in both sexes at a rather lite period of life ; 
and in this case the variations would be transferred to 
the offspring of both sexes at a corresponding late age ; 
and there would then be no real contradiction to the 
rule that variations occurring late in life are transferred 
exclusively to the sex in which they first appeared. 
This latter rule seems to hold true more generally than 
the second one, namely, that variations which occur in 
either sex early in life tend to be transferred to both 
sexes. As it was obviously impossible even to estimate 
in how large a number of cases throughout the animal 
kingdom these two propositions held good, it occurred 
to me to investigate some striking or crucial instances, 
and to rely on the result. 

An excellent case for investigation is afforded by the

Deer family. In all the species, but one, the horns 
are developed only in the males, though certainly 
transmitted through the females, and capable of ab- 
normal development in them. In the reindeer, on the 
other hand, the female is provided with horns ; so that 
in this species, the horns ought, according to our rule, 
to appear early in life, long before the two sexes are 
mature and have come to differ much in constitution. 


In all the other species the horns ought to appear later 
in life, which would lead to their development in that 
sex alone, in which they first appeared in the progeni- 
tor of the whole Family. Now in seven species, 
belonging to distinct sections of the family and 
inhabiting different regions, in which the stags alone 
bear horns, I find that the horns first appear at periods, 
varying from nine months after birth in the roebuck, 
to ten, twelve or even more months in the stags of the 
six other and larger species.^® But with the reindeer 
the case is widely different ; for, as I hear from Prof. 
Nilsson, who kindly made special enquiries for me in 
Lapland, the horns appear in the young animals within 
four or five weeks after birth, and at the same time in 
both sexes. So that here we have a structure, deve- 
loped at a most unusually early age in one species of 
the family, and likewise common to both sexes in this 
one species alone. 


I am much obliged to Mr. 
Cupples for having made en-

In several kinds of antelopes, only the males are 
provided with horns, whilst in the greater number 
both sexes bear horns. With respect to the period of 
development, Mr. Blyth informs me that there was at 
one time in the Zoological Gardens a young koodoo 
{Ant. strejpsiceros)^ of which the males alone are horned, 
and also the young of a closely-allied species, the eland 
{Ant. oreas), in which both sexes are horned. Now it 
is in strict conformity with our rule, that in the young 
male koodoo, although ten months old, the horns were 
remarkably small, considering the size ultimately 
attained by them ; whilst in the young male eland, 
although only three months old, the horns were already 
very much larger than in the koodoo. It is also a 
noticeable fact that in the prong-horned antelope,*® 
only a few of the females, about one in five, have horns, 
and these are in a rudimentary state, though sometimes 
above four inches long ; so that as far as concerns the 
possession of horns by the males alone, this species is 
in an intermediate condition, and the horns do not 
appear until about five or six months after birth. 
Therefore in comparison with what little we know of 
the development of the horns in other antelopes, and 
from what we do know with respect to the horns of 
deer, cattle, &c., those of the prong-horned antelope 
appear at an intermediate period of life, — that is, not 
very early, as in cattle and sheep, nor very late, as in 
the larger deer and antelopes. The horns of sheep, 
goats, and cattle, which are well developed in both 
sexes, though not quite equal in size, can be felt, or

even seen, at birth or soon afterwards/^ Our rule, 
however, seems to fail in some ibreeds of sheep, for 
instance merinos, in which the rams alone are horned ; 
for I cannot find on enquiry that the horns are 
developed later in life in this breed than in ordinary 
sheep in which both sexes are horned. But with 
domesticated sheep the presence or absence of horns is 
not a firmly fixed character ; for a certain proportion 
of the merino ewes bear small horns, and some of the 
rams are hornless ; and in most breeds hornless ewes 
are occasionally produced. 

Dr. W. Marshall has lately made a special study of 
the protuberances so common on the heads of birds, 
and he comes to the following conclusion ; — that with 
those species in which they are confined to the males, 
they are developed late in life ; whereas with those 
species in which they are common to the two sexes, 
they are developed at a very early period. This is 
certainly a striking confirmation of my two laws of 
inheritance. 

In most of the species of the splendid family of the 


I have been assured that 
the horns of the sheep in North 
Wales can always felt, and 
are sometimes even an inch in 
length, at birth. Youatt says 
(‘ Cattle,’ 1834, p. 277), that the 
prominence of the frontal bone 
in cattle penetrates the cutis 
at birth, and that the horny 
matter is soon formed over it. 

I am greatly indebted to 
Prof. Victor Cams for having 
made enquiries for me, from the 
highest authorities, with respect 
to the merino sheep of Saxony. 
On the Guinea coast of Africa 
there is, however, a breed of sheep 


in which, as with merinos, the 
rams alone bear horns ; and Mr. 
Win wood Reade informs me 
that in one case observed by 
him, a young ram, bom on 
Feb. 10th, first shewed horns 
on March 6th, so that in this 
instance, in conformity with 
mle, the development of the 
horns occurred at a later period 
of life than in Welsh sheep, in 
which both sexes are homed.

Pheasants, the males differ conspicuously from the 
females, and they acquire their ornaments at a rather 
late period of life. The eared pheasant (CrossopHlon 
auritum), however, offers a remarkable exception, for 
both sexes possess the fine caudal plumes, the large 
ear-tufts and the crimson velvet about the head ; I 
find that all these characters appear very early in life 
in accordance with rule. The adult male can, how- 
ever, be distinguished from the adult female by the 
presence of spurs ; and conformably with our rule, 
these do not begin to be developed before the age of six 
months, as I am assured by Mr. Bartlett, and even at 
this age, the two sexes can hardly be distinguished.*^ 
The male and' female Peacock differ conspicuously from 
each other in almost every part of their plumage, 
except in the elegant head-crest, which is common to 
both sexes ; and this is developed very early in life, 
long before the other ornaments, which are confined to 
the male. The wild-duck offers an analogous case, for 
the beautiful green speculum on the wings is common 
to both sexes, though duller and somewhat smaller in 
the female, and it is developed early in life, whilst the 
curled tail-feathers and other ornaments of the male 


are developed later.*® Between such extreme cases of 


** In the common peacock 
(Favo cristatus) the male alone 
possesses spurs, whilst both sexes 
of the Java Peacock (P. muticus) 
offer the unusual case of being 
furnished with spurs. Hence I 
fully expected that in the latter 
species they would have been 
developed earlier in life than in 
the common peacock ; but M. 
Hegt of Amsterdam informs me, 
that with young birds of the 
previous year, of both species, 


compared on April 23rd, 1869, 
there was bo difference in the 
development of the spurs. The 
spurs, however, were as yet re- 
presented merely by slight knobs 
or elevations. I presume that I 
should have been informed if 
any difference in the rate of 
development had been observed 
subsequently.

the Duck family the speculum

close sexual resemblance and wide dissimilarity, as 
those of the Crossoptilon and peacock, many inter- 
mediate ones could be given, in which the characters 
follow our two rules in their order of development. 

As most insects emerge from the pupal state in a 
mature condition, it is doubtful whether the period of 
development can determine the transference of their 
characters to one or to both sexes. But we do not 
know that the coloured scales, for instance, in two 
species of butterflies, in one of which the sexes diflfer in 
colour, whilst in the other they are alike, are developed 
at the same relative age in the cocoon. Nor do we 
know whether all the scales are simultaneously deve- 
loped on the wings of the same species of butterfly, in 
which certain coloured marks are confined to one sex, 
whilst others are common to both sexes. A difi’erence 
of this kind in the period of development is not so 
improbable as it may at first appear ; for with the 
Orthoptera, which assume their adult state, not by a 
single metamorphosis, but by a succession of moults, 
the young males of some species at first resemble 
the females, and acquire their distinctive masculine 


two sexes ; but I have not been 
able to discover whether its full 
development occurs later in life 
in the males of such species, 
than in the male of the common 
duck, as ought to be the case 
according to our rule. With 
the allied Mergus cucullatui we 
have, however, a case of this 
kind : the two sexes differ con- 
spicuously in general plumage, 
and to a considerable degree in 
the speculum, which is pure 


white in the male and greyish- 
white in the female. Now the 
young males at first entirely 
resemble the females, and have a 
greyish- white speculum, which 
becomes pure white at an earlier 
age than that at which the adult 
male acquires his other and 
more strongly-marked sexual 
differences : see Audubon, ‘ Or- 
nithological Biography,’ vol. iii. 
Ib35, pp. 249-250.

characters only at a later moult. Strictly analogous 
cases occur at the successive moults of certain male 
crustaceans. 

We have as yet considered the transference of 
characters, relatively to their period of development, 
only in species in a natural state ; we will now turn to 
domesticated animals, and first touch on monstrosities 
and diseases. The presence of supernumerary digits, 
and the absence of certain phalanges, must he deter- 
mined at an early embryonic period — the tendency to 
profuse bleeding is at least congenital, as is probably 
colour-blindness — yet these peculiarities, and other 
similar ones, are often limited in their transmission to 
one sex ; so that the rule that characters, developed at 
an early period, tend to be transmitted to both sexes, 
here wholly fails. But this rule, as before remarked, 
does not appear to be nearly so general as the converse 
one, namely, that characters which appear late in life 
in one sex are transmitted exclusively to the same sex. 
From the fact of the above abnormal peculiarities be- 
coming attached to one sex, long before the sexual func- 
tions are active, we may infer that there must be some 
difference between the sexes at an extremely early age. 
With respect to sexually-limited diseases, we know too 
little of the period at which they originate, to draw 
any safe conclusion. Gout, however, seems to fall 
under our rule, for it is generally caused by intemper- 
ance during manhood, and is transmitted from the 
father to his sons in a much more marked manner than 
to his daughters. 

In the various domestic breeds of sheep, goats, and 
cattle, the males differ from their respective females in 
the shape or development of their horns, forehead,

mane, dewlap, tail, and hump on the shoulders; and 
these peculiarities, in accordance with our rule, are not 
fully developed until a rather late period of life. The 
sexes of dogs do not differ, except that in certain 
breeds, especially in the Scotch deer-hound, the male 
is much larger and heavier than the female ; and, as 
we shall see in a future chapter, the male goes on 
increasing in size to an unusually late period of life, 
which, according to rule, will account for his increased 
size being transmitted to his male offspring alone. On 
the other hand, the tortoise-shell colour, which is con- 
fined to female cats, is quite distinct at birth, and this 
case violates the rule. There is a breed of pigeons in 
which the males alone are streaked with black, and the 
streaks can be detected even in the nestlings ; but they 
become more conspicuous at each successive moult, so 
that this case partly opposes and partly supports the 
rule. With the English Carrier and Pouter pigeons, 
the full development of the wattle and the crop occurs 
rather late in life, and conformably with the rule, 
these characters are transmitted in full perfection to 
the males alone. The following cases perhaps come with- 
in the class previously alluded to, in which both sexes 
have varied in the same manner at a rather late period 
of life, and have consequently transferred their new 
characters to both sexes at a corresponding late period ; 
and if so, these cases are not opposed to our rule : — 
there exist sub-breeds of the pigeon, described by 
Neumeister,*® in which both sexes change their colour 
during two or three moults (as is likewise the case 
with the Almond Tumbler), nevertheless, these changes,

though occurring rather late in life, are common to 
both sexes. One variety of the Canary-bird, namely 
the London Prize, offers a nearly analogous case. 

With the breeds of the Fowl the inheritance of 
various characters by one or both sexes, seems generally 
determined by the period at which such characters are 
developed. Thus in all the many breeds in which the 
adult male differs greatly in colour from the female, 
as well as from the wild parent-species, he differs also 
from the young male, so that the newly-acquired 
characters must have appeared at a rather late period 
of life. On the other hand, in most of the breeds in 
which the two sexes resemble each other, the young 
are coloured in nearly the same manner as their 
parents, and this renders it probable that their 
colours first appeared early in life. We have instances 
of this fact in all black and white breeds, in which the 
young and old of both sexes are alike ; nor can it be 
maintained that there is something peculiar in a black 
or white plumage, which leads to its transference to 
both sexes ; for the males alone of many natural 
species are either black or white, the females being 
differently coloured. With the so-called Cuckoo sub- 
breeds of the fowl, in which the feathers are trans- 
versely pencilled with dark stripes, both sexes and the 
chickens are coloured in nearly the same manner. 
The laced plumage of the Sebright bantam is the same 
in both sexes, and in the young chickens the wing- 
feathers are distinctly, though imperfectly laced. 
Spangled Hamburgs, however, offer a partial excep- 
tion ; for the two sexes, though not quite alike, 
resemble each other more closely than do the sexes of 
the aboriginal parent-species ; yet they acquire their 


Chap. Mil. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


369 


characteristic plumage late in life, for the chickens are 
distinctly pencilled. With respect to other characters 
besides colour, in the wild-parent species and in most 
of the domestie breeds, the males alone possess a well- 
developed comb ; but in the young of the Spanish fowl 
it is largely developed at a very early age, and, in 
accordance with this early development in the male, it 
is of unusual size in the adult female. In the Game 
breeds pugnacity is developed at a wonderfully early 
age, of which curious proofs could he given ; and this 
character is transmitted to both sexes, so that the hens, 
from their extreme pugnacity, are now generally 
exhibited in separate pens. With the Polish breeds 
the bony protuberance of the skull which supports the 
crest is partially developed even before the chickens 
are hatched, and the crest itself soon begins to grow, 
though at first feebly ; and in this breed the adults 
of both sexes a're characterised by a great bony pio- 
tuberance and an immense crest. 

Finally, from what we have now seen of the relation 
which exists in many natural species and domesticated 
races, between the period of the development of their 
characters and the manner of their transmission — for 
example, the striking fact of the early growth of the 
horns in the reindeer, in which both sexes bear horns, 
in comparison with their much later growth in the 
other species in which the male alone bears horns — we 
may conclude that one, though not the sole cause of

characters being exclusively inherited by one sex, is 
their development at a late age. And secondly, that 
one, though apparently a less efficient cause of 
^ characters being inherited by both sexes, is their deve- 
lopment at an early age, whilst the sexes dijder but 
little in constitution. It appears, however, that some 
difference must exist between the sexes even during a 
very early embryonic period, for characters developed 
at this age not rarely become attached to one sex. 

Summary and concluding remarks . — From the fore- 
going discussion on the various laws of inheritance, we 
learn that the characters of the parents often, or even 
generally, tend to become developed in the offspring of 
the same sex, at the same age, and periodically at the 
same season of the year, in which they first appeared 
in the parents. But these rules, owing to unknown 
causes, are far from being fixed. Hence during the 
modification of a species, the successive changes may 
readily be transmitted in different ways ; some to one 
sex, and some to both ; some to the offspring at one 
age, and some to the offspring at all ages. Not only 
are the laws of inheritance extremely complex, but so are 
the causes which induce and govern variability. The 
variations thus induced are preserved and accumulated 
by sexual selection, which is in itself an extremely 
complex affair, depending, as it does, on the ardour 
in love, the courage, and the rivalry of the males, as 
well as on the powers of perception, the taste, and will 
of the female. Sexual selection will also be largely 
dominated by natural selection tending towards the 
general welfare of the species. Hence the manner in 
which the individuals of either or both sexes have been 


Chap. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


871 


affected through sexual selection cannot fail to be com- 
plex in the highest degree. 

When variations occur late in life in one sex, and 
are transmitted to the same sex at the same age, the 
other sex and the young are left unmodified. When 
they occur late in life, but are transmitted to both sexes 
at the same age, the young alone are left unmodified. 
Variations, however, may occur at any period of life in 
one sex or in both, and be transmitted to both sexes at 
all ages, and then all the individuals of the species are 
similarly modified. In the following chapters it will be 
seen that all these cases frequently occur in nature. 

Sexual selection can never act on any animal before 
the age for reproduction arrives. From the great 
eagerness of the male it has generally acted on this sex 
and not on the females. The males have thus become 
provided with weapons for fighting with their rivals, 
with organs for discovering and securely holding the 
female, and for exciting or charming her. When the 
sexes differ in these respects, it is also, as we have 
seen, an extremely general law that the adult male 
differs more or less from the young male ; and we may 
conclude from this fact that the successive variations, 
by which the adult male became modified, did not 
generally occur much before the age for reproduction. 
Whenever some or many of the variations occurred 
early in life, the young males would partake more or 
less of the characters of the adult males ; and differ- 
ences of this kind between the old and young males may 
be observed in many species of animals. 

It is probable that young male animals have often 
tended to vary in a manner which would not only have 
been of no use to them at an early age, but would have 


372 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Pabt II. 


been actually injurious — as by acquiring bright colours, 
which would render them conspicuous to their enemies, 
or by acquiring structures, such as great horns, which 
would expend much vital force in their development. 
Variations of this kind occurring in the young males 
would almost certainly be eliminated through natural 
selection. With the adult and experienced males, on 
the other hand, the advantages derived from the acquisi- 
tion of such characters, would more than counterbalance 
some exposure to danger, and some loss of vital force. 

As variations which give to the male a better chance 
of conquering other males, or of finding, securing, or 
charming the opposite sex, would, if they happened to 
arise in the female, be of no service to her, they would 
not be preserved in her through sexual selection. We 
have also good evidence with domesticated animals, 
that variations of all kinds are, if not carefully selected, 
soon lost through intercrossing and accidental deaths. 
Consequently in a state of nature, if variations of the 
above kind chanced to arise in the female line, and to 
be transmitted exclusively in this line, they would be 
extremely liable to be lost. If, however, the females 
varied and transmitted their newly acquired characters 
to their offspring of both sexes, the characters which 
were advantageous to the males would be preserved by 
them through sexual selection, and the two sexes would 
in consequence be modified in the same manner, al- 
though such characters were of no use to the females : 
but I shall hereafter have to recur to these more 
intricate contingencies. Lastly, the females may 
acquire, and apparently have often acquired by trans- 
ference, characters from the male sex. 

As variations occurring late in life, and transmitted 


Chat. VIII. 


SEXUAL SELECTION. 


373 


to one sex alone, have incessantly been taken advantage 
of and accumulated through sexual selection in relation 
to the reproduction of the species ; therefore it appears, 
at first sight, an unaccountable fact that similar 
variations have not frequently been accumulated 
through natural selection, in relation to the ordinary 
habits of life. If this had occurred, the two sexes 
would often have been differently modified, for the 
sake, for instance, of capturing prey or of escaping 
from danger. Differences of this kind between the 
two sexes do occasionally occur, especially in the lower 
classes. But this implies that the two sexes follow 
different habits in their struggles for existence, which 
is a rare circumstance with the higher animals. The 
case, however, is widely different with the reproductive 
functions, in which respect the sexes necessarily differ. 
For variations in structure which are related to these 
functions, have often proved of value to one sex, and 
from having arisen at a late period of life, have been 
transmitted to one sex alone ; and such variations, thus 
preserved and transmitted, have given rise to secondary 
sexual characters. 

In the following chapters, I shall treat of the 
secondary sexual characters in animals of all classes, 
and shall endeavour in each case to apply the principles 
explained in the present chapter. The lowest classes 
will detain us for a very short time, but the higher 
animals, especially birds, must be treated at consider- 
able length. It should be borne in mind that for 
reasons already assigned, I intend to give only a few 
illustrative instances of the innumerable structures by 
the aid of which the male finds the female, or, when 
found, holds her. On the other hand, all structures

and instincts by the aid of which the male conquers 
other males, and by which he allures or excites the 
female, will be fully discussed, as these are in many 
ways the most interesting. 

Supplement on the proportional numbers of the two sexes 
in animals belonging to various classes. 

As no one, as far as I can discover, has paid atten- 
tion to the relative numbers of the two sexes through- 
out the animal kingdom, I will here give such materials 
as I have been able to collect, although’ they are 
extremely imperfect. They consist in only a few 
instances of actual enumeration, and the numbers are 
not very large. As the proportions are known with 
certainty only in mankind, I will first give them as a 
standard of comparison. 

Man. — In England during ten years (from 1857 to 
1866) the average number of children born alive yearly 
was 707,120, in the proportion of 104*5 males to 100 
females. But in 1857 the male births throughout 
England were as 105*2, and in 1865 as 104 0 to 100. 
Looking to separate districts, in Buckinghamshire 
(where about 5000 children are annually born) the mean 
proportion of male to female births, during the whole 
period of the above ten years, was as 102 8 to 100 ; 
whilst in N. Wales (where the average annual hirths 
are 12,873) it was as high as 106*2 to 100. Taking a 
still smaller district, viz., Eutlandshire (where the 
annual births average only 739), in 1864 the male 
births were as 114*6, and in 1862 as only 97*0 to 100; 
but even in this small district the average of the 7385 
births during the whole ten years, was as 104*5 to 100 ; 


Chap. VIII. PROPORTION OF THE SEXES. 


375 


that is in the same ratio as throughout England/® 
The proportions are sometimes slightly disturbed by 
unknown causes; thus Prof. Faye states that in some 
districts of Norway there has been during a decennial 
“ period a steady deficiency of boys, whilst in others 
the opposite condition has existed.” In France 
during forty-four years the male to the female births 
have been as 106*2 to 100 ; but during this period it 
has occurred five times in one department, and six times 
in another, that the female births have exceeded the 
males. In Kussia the average proportion is as high as 
108 9, and in Philadelphia in the United States as 110*5 
to 100.'*^ The average for Europe, deduced by Bickes 
from about seventy million births, is 106 males to 100 
females. On the other hand, with white children born 
at the Cape of Good Hope, the proportion of males is so 
low as to fluctuate during successive years between 90 
and 99 males for every 100 females. It is a singular 
fact that with Jews the proportion of male births is 
decidedly larger than with Christians : thus in Prussia 
the proportion is as 113, in Breslau as 114, and in 
Livonia as 120 to 100 ; the Christian births in these 
countries being the same as usual, for instance, in 
Livonia as 104 to 100.^°

Prof. Faye remarks that “ a still greater preponder- 
“ ance of males would be met with, if death struck both 
“ sexes in equal proportion in the womb and during 
“ birth. But the fact is, that for every 100 still-born 
“females, we have in several countries from 134*6 to 
“ 144'9 still-born males. During the first four or five 
“ years of life, also, more male children die than females, 
“ for example in England, during the first year, 126 
“ hoys die for every 100 girls — a proportion which in 
“ France is still more unfavourable.”®^ Dr. Stockton- 
Hough accounts for these facts in part by the more 
frequent defective development of males than of females. 
We have before seen that the male sex is more 
variable in structure than the female ; and variations 
in important organs would generally be injurious 
But the size of the body, and especially of the head, 
being greater in male than female infants is another 
cause : for the males are thus more liable to be injured 
during parturition. Consequently the still-born males 
are more numerous ; and, as a highly competent judge. 
Dr. Crichton Browne,®^ believes, male infants often

Scotland,’ 1867, p. xxviii.) that 
“ These examples may suffice to 
“show that, at almost every 
“stage of life, the males in 
“ Scotland have a greater lia- 
“ bility to death and a higher 
“death-rate than the females. 
“ The fact, however, of this 
“ peculiarity being most strongly 
“developed at that infantile 
“ period of life when the dress,

that the head ol the male infant 
exceeds that of the female by 
3-8ths of an inch in circumfer- 
ence, and by l-8th in transverse 
diameter. Quetelet has shown 
that woman is born smaller than 
man ; see Dr. Duncan, ‘ Fecun- 
dity, Fertility, Sterility,’ 1871,

suffer in health for some years after birth. Owing to 
this excess in the death-rate of male children, both 
at birth and for some time subsequently, and owing to 
the exposure of grown men to various dangers, and to 
their tendency to emigrate, the females in all old- 
settled countries, where statistical records have been 
kept,®^ are found to preponderate considerably over 
the males. 

It seems at first sight a mysterious fact that in 
different nations, under different conditions and cli- 
mates, in Naples, Prussia, Westphalia, Holland, France, 
England and the United States, the excess of male over 
female births is less when they are illegitimate than 
when legitimate.®^ This has been explained by 
different writers in many different ways, as from the 
mothers being generally young, from the large pro- 
portion of first pregnancies, &c. But we have seen 
that male infants, from the large size of their heads, 
suffer more than female infants during parturition ; 
and as the mothers of illegitimate children must be 
more liable than other women to undergo bad labours, 
from various causes, such as attempts at concealment 
by tight lacing, hard work, distress of mind, &c., their 
male infants would proportionably suffer. And this 
probably is the most efficient of all the causes of the 
proportion of males to females born alive being less 
amongst illegitimate children than amongst the legiti- 
mate. With most animals the greater size of the adult

male than of the female, is due to the stronger males 
having conquered the weaker in their struggles for the 
possession of the females, and no doubt it is owing to 
this fact that the two sexes of at least some animals 
differ in size at birth. Thus we have the curious fact 
that we may attribute the more frequent deaths of 
male than female infants, especially amongst the ille- 
gitimate, at least in part to sexual selection. 

It has often been supposed that the relative age of 
the two parents determines the sex of the offspring ; 
and Prof. Leuckart^® has advanced what he considers 
sufficient evidence, with respect to man and certain 
domesticated animals, that this is one important 
though not the sole factor in the result. So again the 
period of impregnation relatively to the state of the 
female has been thought by some to be the efficient 
cause ; but recent observations discountenance this 
belief. According to Dr. Stockton-Hough,'^® the season 
of the year, the poverty or wealth of the parents, 
residence in the country or in cities, the crossing of 
foreign immigrants, &c., all influence the proportion 
of the sexes. With mankind, polygamy has also 
been supposed to lead to the birth of a greater pro- 
portion of female infants ; but Dr. J. Campbell care- 
fully attended to this subject in the harems of Siam, and 
concludes that the proportion of male to female births 
is the same as from monogamous unions. Hardly any 
animal has been rendered so highly polygamous as the 
English race-horse, and we shall immediately see that 
his male and female offspring are almost exactly equal

in number. I will now give the facts which I have 
collected with respect to the proportional numbers of 
the sexes of various animals; and will then briefly 
discuss how far selection has come into play in de- 
termining the result. 

Horses. — Mr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to tabulate for me 
from the ‘ Racing Calendar ’ the births of race-horses during a period 
of twenty-one years, viz., from 1846 to 1867 ; 1849 being omitted, 
as no returns were that year published. The total births were 
25,560,®* consisting of 12,763 males and 12,797 females, or in the 
proportion of 99*7 males to 100 females. As these numbers are 
tolerably large, and as they are drawn from all parts of England, 
during several years, we may with much confidence conclude that 
with the domestic horse, or at least with the race- horse, the two 
sexes are produced in almost equal numbers. The fluctuations in 
the proportions during successive years are closely like those which 
occur with mankind, when a small and thinly-populated area is 
considered ; thus in 1856 the male horses were as 107*1, and in 
1867 as only 92*6 to 100 females. In the tabulated returns the 
proportions vary in cycles, for the males exceeded the females 
during six successive years ; and the females exceeded the males 
during two periods each of four years : this, however, may be 
accidental ; at least I can detect nothing of the kind with man in 
the decennial table in the Registrar’s Report for 1866. 

Dogs . — During a period of twelve years, from 1857 to 1868, the 
births of a large number of greyhounds, throughout England, were 
sent to the ‘ Field ’ newspaper ; and I am again indebted to Mr. 
Tegetmeier for carefully tabulating the results. The recorded births 
were 6878, consisting of 3605 males and 3273 females, that is, in 


®* During eleven years a re- 
cord was kept of the number of 
mares which proved barren or 
prematurely slipped their foals ; 
and it deserves notice, as shew- 
ing how infertile these highly - 
nurtured and rather closely- 
interbred animals have become, 
that not far from one-third of 


the mares failed to produce 
living foals. Thus during 1866, 
809 male colts and 816 female 
colts were born, and 743 mares 
failed to produce offspring. 
During 1867, 836 males and 
902 females were bom, and 
794 mares failed.

the proportion of 110*1 males to 100 females. The greatest fluctua- 
tions occurred in 1864, when the proportion was as 95*3 males, and 
in 1867, as 116*3 males to 100 females. The above average pro- 
portion of 110*1 to 100 is probably nearly correct in the case of the 
greyhound, but whether it would hold with other domesticated 
breeds is in some degree doubtful. Mr. Guppies has enquired from 
several great breeders of dogs, and finds that all without exception 
believe that females are produced in excess ; but he suggests that 
this belief may have arisen from females being less valued, and 
from the consequent disappointment producing a stronger im- 
pression on the mind. 

Sheep . — The sexes of sheep are not ascertained by agriculturists 
until several months after birth, at the period when the males are 
castrated ; so that the following returns do not give the proportions 
at birth. Moreover, I find that several great breeders in Scotland, 
who annually raise some thousand sheep, are firmly convinced that 
a larger proportion of males than of females die during the first year 
or two. Therefore the proportion of males would be somewhat 
larger at birth than at the age of castration. This is a remarkable 
coincidence with what, as we have seen, occurs with mankind, and 
both cases probably depend on the same cause. I have received 
returns from four gentlemen in England who have bred Lowland 
sheep, chiefly Leicestcrs, during the last ten to sixteen years ; they 
amount altogether to 8965 births, consisting of 4407 males and 4558 
females ; that is in the proportion of 96*7 males to 100 females. 
With respect to Cheviot and black- faced sheep bred in Scotland, I 
have received returns from six breeders, two of them on a large 
scale, chiefly for the years 1867-1869, but some of the returns 
extend back to 1862. The total number recorded amounts to 
50,685, consisting of 25,071 males and 25,614 females, or in the 
proportion of 97*9 males to 100 females. If we take the English 
and Scotch returns together, the total number amounts to 59,650, 
consisting of 29,478 males and 30,172 females, or as 97*7 to 100. 
So that with sheep at the age of castration the females are certainly 
in excess of the males, but probably this would not hold good at 
birth.“ 


I am much indebted to 
Mr. Guppies for having pro- 
cured for me the above returns 
from Scotland, as well as some 
of the following returns on 


cattle. Mr. R. Elliot, of Laigh- 
wood, first called my attention 
to the premature deaths of the 
males, — a statement subsequent- 
ly confirmed by Mr. Altchisop 


Chap. VIII. PROPORTION OF THE SEXES. 


381 


Of Cattle I have received returns from nine gentlemen of 982 
births, too few to be trusted ; these consisted of 477 bull-calves and 
505 cow-calves ; i.e., in the proportion of 94'4 males to 100 females. 
The Rev. W. D. Fox informs me that in 1867 out of 34 calves 
born on a farm in Derbyshire only one was a bull. Mr. Harrison 
Weir has enquired from several breeders of Pigs^ and most of them 
estimate the male to the female births as about 7 to 6. This same 
gentleman has bred Pabhits for many years, and has noticed that a 
far greater number of bucks are produced than does. But estima- 
tions are of little value. 

Of mammalia in a state of nature I have been able to learn very 
little. In regard to the common rat, I have received conflicting 
statements. Mr. R. Elliot, of Laighwood, informs me that a rat- 
catcher assured him that he had always found the males in great 
excess, even with the young in the nest. In consequence of this, 
Mr. Elliot himself subsequently examined some hundred old ones, 
and found the statement true. Mr. F. Buckland has bred a large 
number of white rats, and he also believes that the males greatly 
“ exceed the females. In regard to Moles, it is said that “ the males 
“ are much more numerous than the females ; ” and as the catching 
of these animals is a special occupation, the statement may perhaps 
be trusted. Sir A. Smith, in describing an antelope of S. Africa 
(Kohus elUpsiprymnus), remarks, that in the herds of this and other 
species, the males are few in number compared with the females : 
the natives believe that they are born in this proportion ; others 
believe that the younger males are expelled from the herds, and Sir 
A. Smith says, that though he has himself never seen herds con- 
sisting of young male« alone, others affirm that this does occur. It 
appears probable that the young when expelled from the herd, would 
often fall a prey to the many beasts of prey of the country. 

BIRDS. 

With respect ^to the Fowly I have received only one account, 
namely, that out of 1001 chickens of a highly-bred stock of Cochins, 
reared during eight years by Mr. Stretch, 487 proved males and 


and others. To this latter Bell, ‘History of British 

gentleman, and to Mr. Payan, Quadrupeds,’ p. 100.

614 females ; i.e., as 94*7 to 100. In re^jard to domestic pigeoni 
there is good evidence either that the males are produced in excess, 
or that they live longer ; for these birds invariably pair, and single 
males, as Mr. Tegetmeier informs me, can always be purchased 
cheaper than females. Usually the two birds reared from the two 
eggs laid in the same nest are a male and a female ; but Mr. Harri- 
son Weir, who has been so large a breeder, says that he has often 
bred two cocks from the same nest, and seldom two hens ; more- 
over, the hen is generally the weaker of the two, and more liable to 
perish. 

With respect to birds in a state of nature, Mr. Gould and others®^ 
are convinced that the males are generally the more numerous ; and 
as the young males of many species resemble the females, the latter 
would naturally appear to be the more numerous. Large numbers 
of pheasants are reared by Mr. Baker of Leadenhall from eggs laid 
by wild bii’ds, and he informs Mr. Jenner Weir that four or five 
males to one female are generally produced. An experienced 
observer remarks,®* that in Scandinavia the broods of the capercailzie 
and black-cock contain more males than females ; and that with 
the Dal-ripa (a kind of ptarmigan) more males than females attend 
the lehs or places of courtship; but this latter circumstance is 
accounted for by some observers by a greater number of hen birds 
being killed by vermin. From various facts given by White of 
Selborne,** it seems clear that the males of the partridge must be 
in considerable excess in the south of England ; and I have been 
assured that this is the case in Scotland. Mr. Weir on enquiring 
from the dealers, who receive at certain seasons large numbers of 
ruffs (MacJietes pugnax\ was told that the males are much the more 
numerous. This same naturalist has also enquired for me from 
the birdcatchers, who annually catch an astonishing number of 
various small species alive for the London market, and he was un- 
hesitatingly answered by an old and trustworthy man, that with 
the chaffinch the males are in large excess ; he thought as high as 
2 males to 1 female, or at least as high as 5 to 3.*® The males 


Brehm (‘Illust. Thierle- 
ben,’ B. iv. s. 990) comes to the 
same conclusion.

of the blackbird, he likewise maintained, were by far the more 
numerous, whether caught by traps or by netting at night. These 
statements may apparently be trusted, because this same man said 
that the sexes are about equal with the lark, the twite (Linaria 
montana)^ and goldfinch. On the other hand, he is certain that 
with the common linnet, the females preponderate greatly, but 
unequally during different years ; during some years he has found 
the females to the males as four to one. It should, however, be 
borne in mind, that the chief season for catching birds does not 
begin till September, so that with some species partial migrations 
may have begun, and the flocks at this period often consist of hens 
alone. Mr. Salvin paid particular attention to the sexes of the 
humming-birds in Central America, and he is convinced that with 
most of the species the males are in excess ; thus one year he pro- 
cured 204 specimens belonging to ten species, and these consisted 
of 166 males and of only 38 females. With two other species 
the females were in excess: but the proportions apparently vary 
either during different seasons or in different localities; for on 
one occasion the males of Campylopterus hemileucurus were to the 
females as 5 to 2, and on another occasion®® in exactly the reversed 
ratio. As beariug on this latter point, I may add, that Mr. Powys 
found in Corfu and Epirus the sexes of the chafiSnch keeping apart, 
and “ the females by far the most numerous ; ” whilst in Palestine 
Mr. Tristram found “ the male flocks appearing greatly to exceed 
“ the female in number.” ®'^ So again with the Quiscalas major y Mr. 
Gr. Taylor ®* says, that in Florida there were “ very few females in 
“ proportion to the males,” whilst in Honduras the proportion was 
the other way, the species there having the character of a polygamist.

FIS FI. 

With Fish the proportional numbers of the sexes can be 
ascertained only by catching them in the adult or nearly adult 
s state; and there are many difficulties in arriving at any just 
conclusion.®® Infertile females might readily be mistaken for 
males, as Dr. Gunther has remarked to me in regard to trout 
With some species the males are believed to die soon after fertilising 
the ova. With many species the males are of much smaller size 
than the females, so that a large number of males would escape 
from the same net by which the females were caught. M. 
Carbonnier,'^® who has especially attended to the natural history 
of the pike {Esox lucius), states that many males, ovdng to their 
small size, are devoured by the larger females ; and he believes 
that the males of almost all fish are exposed from this same cause 
to greater danger than the females. Nevertheless, in the few cases 
in which the proportional numbers have been actually observed, 
the males appear to be largely in excess. Thus Mr. R. Buist, the 
superintendent of the Stormontfield experiments, says that in 
1865, out of 70 salmon first landed for the purpose of obtaining the 
ova, upwards of 60 were males. In 1867 he again “ calls attention 
“ to the vast disproportion of the males to the females. We had at 
“ the outset at least ten males to one female.” Afterwards females 
sufficient for obtaining ova were procured. He adds, “ from the 
“ great proportion of the males, they are constantly fighting and 
“ tearing each other on the spawning-beds.” This disproportion, 
no doubt, can be accounted for in part, but whether whoUy is 
doubtful, by the males ascending the rivers before the females. 
Mr. F. Buckland remarks in regard to trout, that “ it is a curious 
“ fact that the males preponderate very largely in number over the 
“ females. It invariably happens that when the first rush of fish 
“ is made to the net, there will be at least seven or eight males to 
“ one female found captive. I cannot quite account for this ; 
“either the males are more numerous than the females, or the

“ latter seek safety by concealment rather than flight.” He then 
adds, that by carefully searching the banks sufficient females for 
obtaining ova can be found.'^^ Mr. H. Lee informs me that out of 
212 trout, taken for this purpose in Lord Portsmouth’s park, 150 
were males and 62 females. 

The males of the Cyprinidae likewise seem to be in excess ; but 
several members of this Family, viz., the carp, tench, bream and 
minnow, appear regularly to follow the practice, rare in the animal 
kingdom, of polyandry ; for the female whilst spawning is always 
attended by two males, one on each side, and in the case of the 
bream by three or four males. This fact is so well known, that it 
is always recommended to stock a pond with two male tenches to 
one female, or at least with three males to two females. With the 
minnow, an excellent observer states, that on the spawning-beds 
the males are ten times as numerous as the females ; when a 
female comes amongst the males, “she is immediately pressed 
“ closely by a male on each side ; and when they have been in that 
“ situation for a time, are superseded by other two males.” 

INS LOTS. 

In this great Class, the Lepidoptera almost alone afford means 
for judging of the proportional numbers of the sexes; for they have 
been collected with special care by many good observers, and have 
been largely bred from the egg or caterpillar state. I had hoped 
that some breeders of silk-moths might have kept an exact record, 
but after writing to France and Italy, and consulting various 
treatises, I cannot find that this has ever been done. The general 
o['inion appears to be that the sexes are nearly equal, but in Italy, 
as I hear from Professor Canestrini, many breeders are convinced 
that the females are produced in excess. This same naturalist, 
however, informs me, that in the two yearly broods of the 
Ailanthus silk-moth {Bomhyx cynthia)^ the males greatly prepon- 
derate in the first, whilst in the second the two sexes are nearly 
equal, or the females rather in excess. * •

have been much struck by the apiDarently enormous preponderance 
of the males.'^^ Thus Mr. Bates,’® in speaking of several species, 
about a hundred in number, which inhabit the Upper Amazons, 
says that the males are much more numerous than the females, 
s even in the proportion of a hundred to one. In North America, 
Edwards, wh.o had great experience, estimates in the genus Papilio 
the males to the females as four to one; and Mr. Walsh, who 
informed me of this statement, says that with P. turnus this is 
certainly the case. In South Africa, Mr. E. Trimen found the 
males in excess in 19 species ; and in one of these, which swarms 
in open places, he estimated the number of males as fifty to one 
female. With another species, in which the males are numerous in 
certain localities, he collected only five females during seven years. 
In the island of Bourbon, M. Maillard states that the males of one 
species of Papilio are twenty times as numerous as the females.” 
Mr. Trimen informs me that as far as he has himself seen, or heard 
from others, it is rare for the females of any butterfly to exceed the 
males in number ; but three South African species perhaps offer an 
exception. Mr. Wallace’® states that the females of Ornithoptera 
crcesus, in the Malay archipelago, are more common and more 
easily caught than the males; but this is a rare butterfly. I may 
here add, that in Hyperythra, a genus of moths, Guen4e says, that 
from four to five females are sent in collections from India for one 
male. 

When this subject of the proportional numbers of the sexes of 
insects was brought before the Entomological Society,’® it was 
generally admitted that the males of most Lepidopiera, in the 
adult or imago state, are caught in greater numbers than the females : 
but this fact was attributed by various observers to the more 
retiring habits of the females, and to the males emerging earlier 
from the cocoon. This latter circumstance is well known to occur 


Leuckart quotes Meinecke 
(Wagner, ‘ Handw.orterbuch der 
Phys.’ B. iv. 1853, s. 775) that 
the males of Butterflies are three 
or four times as numerous as 
the females.

with most Lepidoptera, as well as with other insects. So that, as 
M. Personnat remarks, the males of the domesticated Bombyx 
Yamamai, are useless at the beginning of the season, and the 
females at the end, from the want of mates.®® I cannot, however, 
persuade myself that these causes suffice to explain the great excess 
of males, in the above cases of certain butterflies which are 
extremely common in their native countries. Mr. Stainton, who 
has paid very close attention during many years to the smaller 
moths, informs me that when he collected them in the imago state, 
he thought that the males were ten times as numerous as the 
females, but that since he has reared them on a large scale from 
the caterpillar state, he is convinced that the females are the more 
numerous. Several entomologist^^ concur in this view. Mr. 
Doubleday, however, and some others, take an opposite view, and 
are convinced that they have reared from the eggs and caterpillars 
a larger proportion of males than of females. 

Besides the more active habits of the males, their earlier 
emergence from the cocoon, and in some cases their frequenting 
more open stations, other causes may be assigned for an apparent 
or real difierence in the proportional numbers of the sexes of 
Lepidoptera, when captured in the imago state, and when reared 
from the egg or caterpillar state. I hear from Professor Canestrini, 
that it is believed by many breeders in Italy, that the female 
caterpillar of the silk-moth suffers more from the recent disease 
than the male; and Dr. Staudinger informs me that in rearing 
Lepidoptera more females die in the cocoon than males. With 
many species the female caterpillar is larger than the male, and a 
collector would naturally choose the finest specimens, and thus 
unintentionally collect a larger number of females. Three collectors 
have told me that this was their practice; but Dr. Wallace is sure 
that most collectors take all the specimens which they can find of 
the rarer kinds, which alone are worth the trouble of rearing. 
Birds when surrounded by caterpillars would probably devour the 
largest; and Professor Canestrini informs me that in Italy some 
breeders believe, though on insufficient evidence, that in the first 
broods of the Ailanthus silk-moth, the wasps destroy a larger 
number of the female than of the male caterpillars. Dr. Wallace 
further remarks that female caterpillars, from being larger than the

J867, p. 487,

males, require more time for their development, nnd consume more 
food and moisture ; and thus they would be exposed uuring a 
longer time to danger from ichneumons, birds, &c., and in times of 
scarcity would perish in greater numbers. Hence it appears quite 
possible that in a state of nature, fewer female Lepidoptera may 
reach maturity than males ; and for our special object we are 
concerned with their relative numbers at maturity, when the sexes 
are ready to propagate their kind. 

The manner in which the males of certain moths congregate in 
extraordinary numbers round a single female, apparently indicates a 
great excess of males, though this fact may perhaps be accounted 
for by the earlier emergence of the males from their cocoons. Mr. 
Stainton informs me that from twelve to twenty males, may often 
be seen congregated round a female Elachista rufocmerea. It is 
well known that if a virgin Lasiocampa q^uercusov Snturnia carpini 
be exposed in a cage, vast numbers of males collect round her, and 
if confined in a room will even come down the chimney to her. 
Mr. Doubleday believes that he has seen from fifly to a hundred 
males of both these s[ ecies attracted in the course of a single day 
by a female in confinement. In the Isle of Wight Mr. Trimen 
exposed a box in which a female of the Lasiocampa had been 
confined on the previous day, and five males soon endeavoured to 
gain admittance. In Australia, M. Verreaux, having placed the 
female of a small Bombyx in a box in his pocket, was followed by 
a crowd of males, so that about 200 entered the house with him.®^ 

Mr. Doublcday has called my attention to M. Staudinger’s list 
of Lepid( -ptera, which gives the prices of the males and females of 
300 species or well-marked varieties of butterflies (Rhopalocera). 
The prices for both sexes of the very common species are of course 
the same; but in 114 of the rarer species they differ; the males 
being in all cases, excepting one, the cheaper. On an average of 
the prices of the 113 species, the price of the male to that of the 
female is as 100 to 149 ; and this apparently indicates that 
inversely the males exceed the females in the same proportion. 
About 2000 species or varieties of moths (Heterocera) are 
catalogued, those with wingless females being liere excluded on 
account of the difference in habits between the two sexes : of these

2000 species, 141 differ in price according to sex, the males of 130 
being cheaper, and those of only 11 being dearer than the females. 
The average price of the males of the 130 species, to that of the 
females, is as 100 to 143. With respect to the butterflies in this 
priced list, Mr. Doubleday thinks (and no man in England has had 
more experience), that there is nothing in the habits of the species 
which can account for the difference in the prices of the two sexes, 
and that it can be accounted for only by an excess in the number 
of the males. But I am bound to add that Dr. Staudinger informs 
me, that he is himself of a different opinion. He thinks that the 
less active habits of the females and the earlier emergence of the 
males will account for his collectors securing a larger number of 
males than of females, and consequently for the lower prices of the 
former. With respect to specimens reared from the caterpillar- 
state, Dr. Staudinger believes, as previously stated, that a greater 
number of females than of males die whilst confined in the 
cocoons. He adds that with certain species one sex seems to pre- 
ponderate over the other during certain years. 

Of direct observations on the sexes of Lepidoptera, reared either 
from eggs or caterpillars, I have received only the few following 
cases : —

So that in these eight lots of cocoons and eggs, males were 
produced in excess. Taken together the proportion of males is as 
122*7 to 100 females. But the numbers are hardly large enough 
to be trustworthy. 

On the whole, from these various sources of evidence, all pointing 
in the same direction, I infer that with most species of Lepidoptera, 
the mature males generally exceed the females in number, whatever 
the proportions may be at their first emergence from the egg. 

With reference to the other Orders of insects, I have been able 
to collect very little reliable information. With the stag-beetle 
(Lucanus cervus) “ the males appear to be much more numerous 
“ than the females ; ” but when, as Cornelius remarked during 1867, 
an unusual number of these beetles appeared in one part of 
Germany, the females appeared to exceed the males as six to one. 
With one of the Elateridae, the males are said to be much more 
numerous than the females, and “ two or three are often found 
“united with one female;®^ so that here polyandry seems to 
“prevail.” With Siagonium (Staphylinidae), in which the males 
are furnished with horns, “ the females are far more numerous than 
“ the opposite sex.” Mr. Janson stated at the Entomological 
Society that the females of the bark-feeding Tomicus villosiis are so 
common as to be a plague, whilst the males are so rare as to be 
hardly known. 

It is hardly worth while saying anything about the proportion of 
the sexes in. certain species and even groups of insects, for the 
males are unknown or very rare, and the females are partheno- 
genetic, that is, fertile without sexual union ; examples of this are 
afforded by several of the Cynipidse.®® In all the gall-making 
Cynipidae known to Mr. Walsh, the females are four or five times 
as numerous as the males ; and so it is, as he informs me, with the 
gall-making Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). With some common species 
of Saw-flies (Tenthredinae) Mr. F. Smith has reared hundreds of 
specimens from larvae of ail sizes, but has never reared a single 


but so many of the figures were 
estimates, that I found it im- 
possible to tabulate them.

male: on the other hand, Curtis says,®® that with certain species 
(Athalia), bred by him, the males were to the females as six to 
one ; whilst exactly the reverse occurred with the mature insects of 
the same species caught in the fields. In the family of Bees, 
Hermann Miiller,®^ collected a large number of specimens of many 
species, and reared others from the cocoons, and counted the sexes. 
He found that the males of some species greatly exceeded the 
females in number ; in others the reverse occurred ; and in others 
the two sexes were nearly equal. But as in most cases the males 
emerge from the cocoons before the females, they are at 1he 
commencement of the breeding season practically in excess. 
Muller also observed that the relative number of the two sexes in 
some species differed much in different localities. But as H. 
Muller has himself remarked to me, these remarks must be 
received with some caution, as one sex might more easily escape 
observation than the other. Thus his brother Fritz Muller has 
noticed in Brazil that the two sexes of the same species of bee 
sometimes frequent different kinds of flowers. With respect to the 
Orthoptera, I know hardly anything about the relative number of 
the sexes: Korte,®® however, says that out of 600 locusts which he 
examined, the males were to the females as five to six. With the 
Neuroptera, Mr. Walsh states that in many, but by no means in 
all the species of the Odonatous group, there is a great overplus of 
males: in the genus Hetajrina, also, the males are generally at 
least four times as numerous as the females. In certain species in 
the genus Gomphus the males are equally in excess, whilst in two 
other species, the females are twice or thrice as numerous as the 
males. In some European species of Psocus thousands of females 
may be collected without a single male, whilst with other species 
of the same genus both sexes are common.®® In England, Mr. 
MacLachlan has captured hundreds of the female Apatania 
muliehrisj but has never seen the male ; and of Boreus hyemalis 
only four or five males have been seen here.®® With most of these

species (excepting the Tenthrediua^) there is at present no evidence 
that the females are subject to parthenogenesis; and thus we see 
how ignorant we are of the causes of the apparent discrepancy in 
the proportion of the two sexes. 

In the other classes of the Articulata I liave been able to collect 
X still less information. With spiders, Mr. Black wall, who has 
carefully attended to this class during many years, writes to me 
that the males from their more erratic habits are more commonly 
seen, and therefore appear more numerous. This is actually the 
case with a few species; but he mentions several species in six 
genera, in which the females appear to be much more numerous 
than the males.®^ The small size of the males in comparison with 
the females (a peculiarity which is sometimes carried to an 
extreme degree), and their widely different appearance, may account 
in some instances for their rarity in collections.^^ 

Some of the lower Crustaceans are able to propagate their kind 
sexually, and this will account for the extreme rarity of the males ; 
thus Von Siebold®^ carefully examined no less than 13,000 
specimens of Apus from twenty-one localities, and amongst these 
he found only 319 males. With some other forms (as Tanais and 
Cypris), as Fritz Muller informs me, there is reason to believe that 
the males are much shorter-lived than the females ; and this would 
explain their scarcity, supposing the two sexes to be at first equal 
In number. On the other hand, Muller has invariably taken far 
more males than females of the Diastylidse and of Cypridina on the 
shores of Brazil: thus with a species in the latter genus, 63 
specimens caught the same day included 57 males ; but he suggests 
that this preponderance may be due to some unknown difference in 
the habits of the two sexes. With one of the higher Brazilian 
crabs, namely a Gelasimus, Fritz Muller found the males to be 
more numerous than the females. According to the large ex- 
perience of Mr. 0. Spence Bate, the reverse seems to be the case 
with six common British crabs, the names of which he has 
given me. 


Another great authority 
with respect to this class, Prof. 
Thorell of Ups.ila (‘On Euro- 
pean Spiders,’ 1869-70, part i. 
p. 205), speaks as if female 
spiders were generally commoner 
than the males.

Chap. VlII. PEOPORTION OP THE SEXES. 


393 


The 'proportion of the sexes in relation to natural 
selection. 

There is reason to suspect that in some cases man 
has by selection indirectly influenced his own sex- 
producing powers. Certain, women tend to produce 
during their whole lives more children of one sex than 
of the other: and the same holds good of many 
animals, for instance, cows and horses ; thus Mr. 
Wright of Yeldersley House informs me that one of 
his Arab mares, though put seven times to different 
horses, produced seven fillies. Though I have very 
little evidence on this head, analogy would lead to the 
belief, that the tendency to produce either sex would 
be inherited like almost every other peculiarity, for 
instance, that of producing twins ; and concerning the 
above tendency a good authority, Mr. J. Downing, has 
communicated to me facts which seem to prove that 
this does occur in certain families of short-horn 
cattle. Col. Marshall has recently- found on careful 
examination that the Todas, a hill-tribe of India, 
consist of 112 males and 84 females of all ages — that 
is in a ratio of 133 *3 males to 100 females. The 
Todas, who are polyandrous in their marriages, during 
former times invariably practised female infanticide; 
but this practice has now been discontinued for a 
considerable period. Of the children born within late , 
years, the males are more numerous than the females, 
in the proportion of 124 to 100. Colonel Marshall 
accounts for this fact in the following ingenious 
manner. ‘‘ Let us for the purpose of illustration take 
“ three families as representing an average of the 
‘ 'Ihe Todas; 1873, pp. 100, 111, 194, 196.

entire tribe ; say that one mother gives birth to six 
“ daughters and no sons ; a second mother has six 
sons only, whilst the third mother has three sons 
“ and three daughters. The first mother, following 
“ the tribal custom, destroys four daughters and 
“ preserves two. The second retains her six sons. 
“ The third kills two daughters and keeps one, as also 
“ her three sons. We have then from the three 
“ families, nine sons and three daughters, with which 
“ to continue the breed. But whilst the males belong 
“ to families in which the tendency to produce sons is 
“ great, the females are of those of a converse inclina- 
‘‘ tion. Thus the bias strengthens with each genera- 
“ tion, until, as we find, families grow to have habitually 
“ more sons than daughters.” 

That this result would follow from the above form 
of infanticide seems almost certain ; that is if we 
assume that a sex-producing tendency is inherited. 
But as the above numbers are so extremely scanty, I 
have searched for additional evidence, but cannot 
decide whether what I have found is trustworthy ; 
nevertheless the facts are, perhaps, worth giving. 
The Maories of New Zealand have long practised 
infanticide ; and Mr. Fenton states that he “ has met 
“ with instances of women who have destroyed four, 
“ six, and even seven children, mostly females. How- 
“ ever, the universal testimony of those best qualified 
“ to judge, is conclusive that this custom has for many 
‘‘ years been almost extinct. Probably the year 1835 
“ may be named as the period of its ceasing to exist.” 
Now amongst the New Zealanders, as with the Todas, 

‘ Aboriginal Inhabitants of New Zealand ; Government Report,’ 
1859, p. 36. 


Chap. VIII. PROPORTION OF THE SEXES.

male births are considerably in excess. Mr. Fenton 
remarks (p. 30), “ One fact is certain, although the 
“ exact period of the commencement of this singular 
“ condition of the disproportion of the sexes cannot be 
“ demonstratively fixed, it is quite clear that this 
“ course of decrease was in full operation during the 
“ years 1830 to 1844, when the non- adult population 
“ of 1844 was being produced, and has continued with 
“ great energy up to the present time.” The following 
statements are taken from Mr. Fenton (p. 26), but as 
the numbers are not large, and as the census was not 
accurate, uniform results cannot be expected. It 
should be borne in mind in this and the following 
cases, that the normal state of every population is an 
excess of women, at least in all civilised countries, 
chiefly owing to the greater mortality of the male sex 
during youth, and partly to accidents of all kinds later 
in life. In 1858, the native population of New 
Zealand was estimated as consisting of 31,667 males 
and 24,303 females of all ages, that is in the ratio of 
130*3 males to 100 females. But during this same 
year, and in certain limited districts, the numbers 
were ascertained with much care, and the males of all 
ages were here 753 and the females 616; that is in 
the ratio of 122*2 males to 100 females. It is more 
important for us that during this same year of 1858, 
the non-adult males within the same district were 
found to be 178, and the non-adult females 142, that is 
in the ratio of 125*3 to 100. It may be added that in 
1844, at which period female infanticide had only 
lately ceased, the non-adult males in one district were 
281, and the non-adult females only 194, that is in the 
ratio of 144 * 8 males to 100 females.

In tlie Sandwich Islands, the males exceed the 
females in number. Infanticide was formerly practised 
there to a frightful extent, but was by no means 
confined to female infants, as is shown by Mr. Ellis,®® 
and as I have been informed by Bishop Staley and the 
Kev. Mr. Coan. Nevertheless, another apparently 
trustworthy writer, Mr. Jarves,®^ whose observations 
apply to the whole archipelago, remarks: — “Numbers 
“ of women are to be found, who confess to the murder 
“ of from three to six or eight children,” and he adds, 
“ females from being considered less useful than males 
“ were more often destroyed.” From what is known 
to occur in other parts of the world, this statement is 
probable ; but must be received with much caution. 
The practice of infanticide ceased about the year 
1819, when idolatry was abolished and missionaries 
settled in the Islands. A careful census in 1839 of 
the adult and taxable men and women in the island of 
Kauai and in one district of Oahu (Jarves, p. 404), 
gives 4723 males and 3776 females; that is in the 
ratio of 125'08 to 100. At the same time the number 
of males under fourteen years in Kauai and under 
eighteen in Oahu was 1797, and of females of the same 
ages 1429 ; and here we have the ratio of 125’75 males 
to 100 females. 

In a census of all the islands in 1850,®® the males of 
all ages amount to 36,272, and the females to 33,128, 
or as 109 49 to 100. The males under seventeen years 
amounted to 10,773, and the females under the same 
age to 9593, or as 11 2-3 to 100. From the census of

1872, the proportion of males of all ages (including 
half-castes) to females, is as 125'36 to 100. It must 
be borne in mind that all these returns for the 
Sandwich Islands give the proportion of living males 
to living females, and not of the births; and judging 
from all civilised countries the proportion of males 
would have been considerably higher if the numbers 
had referred to births.^® 


Dr. Coulter, in describing 
(‘ Journal R. Geograph. Soc,’ 
vol. V. 1835, p. 67) the state of 
California about the year 1830, 
says that the natives, reclaimed 
by the Spanish missionaries, 
have nearly all perished, or are 
perishing, although well treated, 
not driven from their native 
land, and kept from the use of 
spirits. He attributes this, in 
great part, to the undoubted 
fact that the men greatly exceed 
the women in number ; but he 
does not know whether this is 
due to a failure of female off- 
spring, or to more females dying 
durin-j early youth. The latter 
alternative, according to all 
analogy, is very improbable. 
He adds that “ infanticide, pro- 
“ perly so called, is not common, 
“though very frequent resource 
“is had to abortion.” If Dr. 
Coulter is correct about infanti- 
cide, this case cannot be ad- 
vanced in support of Colonel 
Marshall’s view. From the 
rapid decrease of the reclaimed 
natives, we may suspect that, 
as in the cases lately given, 
their fertility has been dimin- 
ished from changed habits of 
life. 

I had hoped to gain some 
light on this subject from the 


breeding of dogs; inasmuch as 
in most breeds, with the ex- 
ception, perhaps, of greyhounds, 
many more female puppies are 
destroyed than males, just as 
with the Toda infants. Mr. 
Cupples assures me that this is 
usual with Scotch deer-hounds. 
Unfortunately, I know nothing 
of the proportion of the sexes in 
any breed, excepting greyhounds, 
and there the male births are to 
the females as llO'l to 100. 
Now from enquiries made from 
many breeders, it seems that 
the females are in some respects 
more esteemed, though other- 
wise troublesome; and it does 
not appear that the female 
puppies of the best- bred dogs 
are systematically destroyed 
more than the males, though 
this does sometimes take place 
to a limited extent. Therefore 
I am unable to decide whether 
we can, on the above principles, 
account for the preponderance of 
male births in greyhounds. On 
the other hand, we have seen 
that with horses, cattle, and 
sheep, which are too valuable for 
the young of either sex to be 
destroyed, if there is any differ- 
ence, the females are slightly ip 
excess. 


398 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Pabt IL 


From tlie several foregoing cases we have some 
reason to believe that infanticide practised in the 
manner above explained, tends to make a male-pro- 
ducing race ; but I am far from supposing that this 
' practice in the case of man, or some analogous process 
with other species, has been the sole determining cause 
of an excess of males. There may be some unknown 
law leading to this result in decreasing races, which 
have already become somewhat infertile. Besides the 
several causes previously alluded to, the greater facility 
of parturition amongst savages, and the less consequent 
injury to their male infants, would tend to increase 
the proportion of live-born males to females. There 
does not, however, seem to he any necessary connection 
between savage life and a marked excess of males; 
that is if we may judge by the character of the scanty 
offspring of the lately existing Tasmanians and of the 
crossed offspring of the Tahitians now inhabiting 
Norfolk Island. 

As the males and females of many animals differ 
som,ewhat in habits and are exposed in different 
degrees to danger, it is probable that in many cases, 
more of one sex than of the other are habitually 
destroyed. But as far as I can trace out the complica- 
tion of causes, an indiscriminate though large de- 
struction of either sex would not tend to modify the 
sex-producing power of the species. With strictly 
social animals, such as bees or ants, which produce a 
vast number of sterile and fertile females in comparison 
with the males, and to whom this preponderance is of 
paramount importance, we can see that those com- 
munities would flourish best which contained females 
having a strong inherited tendency to produce more 


Chap. VIH. PROPOETION OF THE SEXES. 


399 


and more females ; and in such cases an unequal sex- 
producing tendency would be ultimately gained through 
natural selection. With animals living in herds or 
troops, in which the males come to the front and 
defend the herd, as with the hisons of North America 
and certain baboons, it is conceivable that a male- 
producing tendency might be gained by natural 
selection; for the individuals of the better defended 
herds would leave more numerous descendants. In the 
case of mankind the advantage arising from having a 
preponderance of men in the tribe is supposed to he 
one chief cause of the practice of female infanticide. 

In no case, as far as we can see, would an inherited 
tendency to produce both sexes in equal numbers or 
to produce one sex in excess, be a direct advantage 
or disadvantage to certain individuals more than to 
others ; for instance, an individual with a tendency to 
produce more males than females would not succeed 
better in the battle for life than an individual with an 
opposite tendency; and therefore a tendency of this 
kind could not be gained through natural selection. 
Nevertheless, there are certain animals (for instance, 
fishes and cirripedes) in which two or more males 
appear to be necessary for the fertilisation of the 
female ; and the males accordingly largely pre- 
ponderate, but it is by no means obvious how this 
male-producing tendency could have been acquired. I 
formerly thought that when a tendency to produce the 
two sexes in equal numbers was advantageous to the 
species, it would follow from natural selection, but I 
now see that the whole problem is so intricate that it 
is safer to leave its solution for the future,

CHAPTEE IX. 

Secondary Sexual Characters in the Lower Classes 
OF THE Animal Kingdom. 

These characters absent in the lowest classes — Hrilliant colours—- 
Mollusca — Annelids — Crustacea, secondary sexual cliaracters 
strongly developed; dimorphism; colour; characters not 
acquired before maturity — Spiders, sexual colours of; stridula- 
tion by the males — Myriapoda. 

With animals belonging to the lower classes, the two 
sexes are not rarely united in the same individual, and 
therefore secondary sexual characters cannot be de- 
veloped. In many cases where the sexes are separate, 
both are permanently attached to some support, and 
the one cannot search or struggle for the other. 
Moreover it is almost certain that these animals have 
too imperfect senses and much too low mental powers, 
to appreciate each other’s beauty or other attractions, 
or to feel rivalry. 

Hence in these classes or sub-kingdoms, such as 
the Protozoa, Coelenterata, Echinodermata, Scolecida, 
secondary sexual characters, of the kind which we have 
to consider, do not occur ; and this fact agrees with 
the belief that such characters in the higher classes 
have been acquired through sexual selection, which 
depends on the will, desire, and choice of either sex. 
Nevertheless some few apparent exceptions occur ; thus, 
as I hear from Dr. Baird ^ the males of certain Entozoa, 


Chai». IX. 


SEXUAL SELECT f ON.

or internal parasitic worms, differ slightly in colour 
from the females ; but we have no reason to suppose 
that such differences have been augmented through 
sexual selection. Contrivances by which the male 
holds the female, and which are indispensable for the 
propagation of the species, are independent of sexual 
selection, and have been acquired through ordinary 
selection. 

Many of the lower animals, whether hermaphrodites 
or with separate sexes, are ornamented with the most 
brilliant tints, or are shaded and striped in an elegant 
manner; for instance, many corals and sea- anemones 
(Actiniae), some jelly-fish (Medusae, Porpita, &c.), some 
Planariae, many star-fishes. Echini, Ascidians, &c. ; but 
we may conclude from the reasons already indicated, 
namely, the union of the two sexes in some of these 
animals, the permanently affixed condition of others, 
and the low mental powers of all, that such colours do 
not serve as a sexual attraction, and have not been 
acquired through sexual selection. It should be borne 
in mind that in no case have we sufficient evidence 
that colours have been thus acquired, except where one 
sex is much more brilliantly or conspicuously coloured 
than the other, and where there is no difference in 
habits between the sexes sufficient to account for their 
different colours. But the evidence is rendered as 
complete as it can ever be, only when the more 
ornamented individuals, almost always the males, 
voluntarily display their attractions before the other 
sex ; for we cannot believe that such display is useless, 
and if it be advantageous, sexual selection will almost 
inevitably follow. We may, however, extend this 
conclusion to both sexes, when coloured alike, if their

colours are plainly analogous to those of one sex alone 
ill certain other species of the same group. 

How, then, are we to account for the beautiful or 
even gorgeous colours of many animals in the lowest 
classes? It appears doubtful whether such colours 
often serve as a protection ; but that we may easily 
err on this head, will be admitted by every one who 
reads Mr. Wallace’s excellent essay on this subject. 
It would not, for instance, at first occur to any one 
that the transparency of the Medusm, or jelly-fish, is 
of the highest service to them as a protection; but 
when we are reminded by Hiickel that not only the 
medusae, but many floating mollusca, crustaceans, and 
even small oceanic fishes partake of this same glass- 
like appearance, often accompanied by prismatic co- 
lours, we can hardly doubt that they thus escape the 
notice of pelagic birds and other enemies. M. Giard 
is also convinced^ that the bright tints of certain 
sponges and ascidians serve as a protection. Con- 
spicuous colours are likewise beneficial to many 
animals as a warning to their would-be devourers that 
they are distasteful, or that they possess some special 
means of defence ; but this subject will be discussed 
more conveniently hereafter. 

We can, in our ignorance of most of the lowest ani- 
mals, only say that their bright tints result either from 
the chemical nature or the minute structure of their 
tissues, independently of any benefit thus derived. 
Hardly any colour is finer than that of arterial blood ; 
but there is no reason to suppose that the colour of the 
blood is in itself any advantage ; and though it adds 
to the beauty of the maiden’s cheek, no one will 
* ‘ Archives de Zoolog. Exp^r./ Oct. 1872, p. 563. 


Chap. IX. 


MOLLUSCS. 


403 


pretend that it has been acquired for this purpose. 
So again with many animals, especially the lower ones, 
the bile is richly coloured ; thus, as I am informed by 
Mr. Hancock, the extreme beauty of the Eolidae (naked 
sea-slugs) is chiefly due to the biliary glands being 
seen through the translucent integuments — this beauty 
being probably of no service to these animals. The 
tints of the decaying leaves in an American forest are 
described by every one as gorgeous ; yet no one sup- 
poses that these tints are of the least advantage to the 
trees. Bearing in mind how many substances closely 
analogous to natural organic compounds have been 
recently formed by chemists, and which exhibit the 
most splendid colours, it would have been a strange 
fact if substances similarly coloured had not often 
originated, independently of any useful end thus 
gained, in the complex laboratory of living organisms. 

The sub-kingdom of the Mollusca . — Throughout this 
great division of the animal kingdom, as far as I can 
discover, secondary sexual characters, such as we are 
here considering, never occur. Nor could they be 
expected in the three lowest classes, namely, in the 
Ascidians, Polyzoa, and Brachiopods (constituting the 
Molluscoida of some authors), for most of these animals 
are permanently affixed to a support or have their 
sexes united in the same individual. In the Lamelli- 
branchiata, or bivalve shells, hermaphroditism is not 
rare. In the next higher class of the Gasteropoda, or 
univalve shells, the sexes are either united or separate. 
But in the latter case the males never possess special 
organs for finding, securing, or charming the females, 
or for fighting with other males. As I am informed 


404 


THE DESCENT OF MAN. 


Pakt II. 


by Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, the sole external difference 
between the sexes consists in the shell sometimes 
differing a little in form ; for instance, the shell of the 
male periwinkle (Littorwa littorea) is narrower and has 
a more elongated spire than that of the female. But 
differences of this nature, it may be presumed, are 
directly connected with the act of reproduction, or 
with the development of the ova. 

The Gasteropoda, though capable of locomotion and 
furnished with imperfect eyes, do not appear to be 
endowed with sufficient mental powers for the members 
of the same sex to struggle together in rivalry, and 
thus to acquire secondary sexual characters. Never- 
theless with the pulmoniferous gasteropods, or land- 
snails, the pairing is preceded by courtship ; for these 
animals, though hermaphrodites, are compelled by 
their structure to pair together. Agassiz remarks,^ 
“ Quiconque a eu I’occasion d’observer les amours des 
limajons, ne saurait mettre en doute la seduction 
“ deployee dans les mouvements et les allures qui 
“ preparent et accomplissent le double embrassement 
“ de ces hermaphrodites.” These animals appear also 
susceptible of some degree of permanent attachment : 
an accurate observer, Mr. Lonsdale, informs me that he 
placed a pair of land-snails, (Helix fomatia), one of 
which was weakly, into a small and ill-provided 
garden. After a short time the strong and healthy 
individual disappeared, and was traced by its track of 
slime over a wall into an adjoining well-stocked garden. 
Mr. Lonsdale concluded that it had deserted its sickly 
mate ; but after an absence of twenty-four hours it 
returned, and apparently communicated the result of

Chap. IX. MOLLUSCS. 405 

its successful exploration, for both then started along 
the same track and disappeared over the wall. 

Even in the highest class of the Mollusca, the 
Cephalopoda or cuttlefishes, in which the sexes are 
separate, secondary sexual characters of the present 
kind do not, as far as I can discover, occur. This is a 
surprising circumstance, as these animals possess 
highly-developed sense-organs and have considerable 
mental powers, as will be admitted by every one who 
has watched their artful endeavours to escape from an 
enemy.^ Certain Cephalopoda, however, are character- 
ised by one extraordinary sexual character, namely 
that the male element collects within one of the arms 
or tentacles, which is then cast off, and clinging by its 
sucking-discs to the female, lives for a time an 
independent life. So completely does the cast-off arm 
resemble a separate animal, that it was described by 
Cuvier as a parasitic worm under the name of Hectoco- 
tyle. But this marvellous structure may be classed 
as a primary rather than as a secondary sexual 
character. 

Although with the Mollusca sexual selection does 
not seem to have come into play ; yet many univalve 
and bivalve shells, such as volutes, cones, scallops, &c., 
are beautifully coloured and shaped. The colours do 
not appear in most cases to be of any use as a pro- 
tection ; they are probably the direct result, as in the 
lowest classes, of the nature of the tissues; the 
patterns and the sculpture of the shell depending on 
its manner of growth. The amount of light seems to 
be influential to a certain extent; for although, as

which I have given in my p. 7.

repeatedly stated by Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, the shells of 
some species living at a profound depth are brightly 
coloured, yet we generally see the lower surfaces, as 
well as the parts covered by the mantle, less highly- 
coloured than the upper and exposed surfaces.'^ In 
some cases, as with shells living amongst corals or 
brightly-tinted sea-weeds, the bright colours may 
serve as a protection.® But that many of the nudi- 
branch mollusca, or sea-slugs, are as beautifully 
coloured as any shells, may be seen in Messrs. Alder 
and Hancock’s magnificent work ; and from information 
kindly given me by Mr. Hancock, it seems extremely 
doubtful whether these colours usually serve as a 
protection. With some species this may be the case, 
as with one kind which lives on the green leaves of 
algae, and is itself bright-green. But many brightly- 
coloured, white, or otherwise conspicuous species, do 
not seek concealment ; whilst again some equally 
conspicuous species, as well as other dull-coloured 
kinds, live under stones and in dark recesses. So that 
with these nudibranch molluscs, colour apparently does 
not stand in any close relation to the nature of the 
places which they inhabit. 

These naked sea-slugs are hermaphrodites, yet they 
pair together, as do land-snails, many of which have 
extremely pretty shells. It’ is conceivable that two 
hermaphrodites, attracted by each other’s greater

beanty, might unite and leave offspring which would 
inherit their parents’ greater beauty. But with such 
lowly-organised creatures this is extremely improbable. 
Nor is it at all obvious how the olffspring from the 
more beautiful pairs of hermaphrodites would have any 
advantage over the offspring of the less beautiful, so as 
to increase in number, unless indeed vigour and beauty 
generally coincided. We have not here the case of a 
number of males becoming mature before the females, 
with the more beautiful males selected by the more 
vigorous females. If, indeed, brilliant colours were 
beneficial to a hermaphrodite animal in relation to its 
general habits of life, the more brightly-tinted in- 
dividuals would succeed best and would increase in 
number; but this would be a case of natural and not 
of sexual selection.

separate, sometimes differ from each other in charac- 
ters of such importance that they have been placed 
under distinct genera or even families, yet the differ- 
ences do not seem of the kind which can he safely 
attributed to sexual selection. These animals are 
often beautifully coloured, but as the sexes do not 
difier in this respect, we are but little concerned with 
them. Even the Nemertians, though so lowly organ- 
ised, “ vie in beauty and variety of colouring with any 
“ other group in the invertebrate series ; ” yet Dr. 
jMcIntosh® cannot discover that these colours are of 
any service. The sedentary annelids become duller-

coloured, according to M. Quatrefages,’ after the 
period of reproduction ; and this I presume may be 
attributed to their less vigorous condition at that 
time. All these worm-like animals apparently stand 
too low in the scale for the individuals of either sex to 
exert any choice in selecting a partner, or for the 
individuals of the same sex to struggle together in 
rivalry. 

Suh’hingdom of the Arthropoda : Class, Crustacea . — 
In this great class we first meet with undoubted 
secondary sexual characters, often developed in a 
remarkable manner. Unfortunately the habits of 
crustaceans are very imperfectly known, and we cannot 
explain the uses of many structures peculiar to one 
sex. With the lower parasitic species the males are of 
small size, and they alone are furnished with perfect 
swimming-legs, antennae and sense-organs ; the females 
being destitute of these organs, with their bodies often 
consisting of a mere distorted mass. But these extra- 
ordinary differences between the two sexes are no doubt 
related to their widely different habits of life, and con- 
sequently do not concern us. In various crustaceans, 
belonging to distinct families, the anterior antennae 
are furnished with peculiar thread-like bodies, which 
are believed to act as smelling-organs, and these are 
much more numerous in the males than in the females. 
As the males, without any unusual development of 
their olfactory organs, would almost certainly be able 
sooner or later to find the females, the increased 
number of the smelling-threads has probably been

acquired through sexual selection, by the better pro- 
vided males having been the more successful in finding 
partners and in producing offspring. Fritz Muller has 
described a remarkable dimorphic species of Tanais, in 
which the male is represented by two distinct forms, 
which never graduate into each other. In the one form 
the male is furnished with more numerous smelling- 
threads, and in the other form with more powerful and 
more elongated chelae or pincers, which serve to hold 
the female. Fritz Muller suggests that these differ- 
ences between the two male forms of the same species 
may have originated in certain individuals having varied 
in the number of the smelling-threads, whilst other 
individuals varied in the shape and size of their chelae ; 
so that of the former, those which were best able to 
find the female, and of the latter, those which were 
best able to hold her, have left the greatest number of 
progeny to inherit their respective advantages.® 

In some of the lower crustaceans, the right anterior 
antenna of the male differs greatly in structure from 
the left, the latter resembling in its simple tapering 
joints the antennas of the female. In the male the 
modified antenna is either swollen in the middle or 


angularly bent, or converted (fig. 4) into an elegant, 
and sometimes wonderfully complex, prehensile organ.® 
It serves, as I hear from Sir J. Lubbock, to hold the

posterior legs (h) on the same side of the body 
is converted into a forceps. In another family 
the inferior or posterior antennm are “ curiously 
zigzagged ” in the males alone. 

rj, In the higher crustaceans the 

anterior legs are developed into 
chelae or pincers; and these are 
generally larger in the male than 
in the female, — so much so that 
the market value of the male 
edible crab { Cancer pagurus), 
cording to Mr. C. Spence Bate, is 
five times as great as that of the 
female. In many species the 
chelae are of unequal size on the 
opposite side of the body, the 
right-hand one being, as I am 
informed by Mr. Bate, generally, 
though not invariably, the largest. 
This inequality is also often much 
greater in the male than in the 
female. The two chelae of the 
male often differ in structure (figs. 
5, 6, and 7), the smaller one 
resembling that of the female. 
What advantage is gained by their 
inequality in size on the opposite 
sides of the body, and by the inequality being much 
greater in the male than in the female; and why, 
when they are of equal size, both are often much 
larger in the male than in the female, is not known. 
As I hear from Mr. Bate, the chelm are sometimes of

fighting with his rivals ; hut this will not account for 
their inequality in the female on the opposite sides of 
the body. In Gelasimus, according to a statement 
quoted by Milne-Edwards,^^ the male and the female 
live in the same burrow, and this shews that they 
pair ; the male closes the mouth of the burrow with 
' one of its chelae, which is enormously developed ; so 
that here it indirectly serves as a means of defence. 
Their main use, however, is probably to seize and to 
secure the female, and this in some instances, as with 
Gammarus, is known to he the case. The male of the 
hermit or soldier crab (Pagurus) for weeks together, 
carries about the shell inhabited by the female.'^ The 
sexes, however, of the common shore-crab {Garcinus 
maenas)f as Mr. Bate informs me, unite directly after 
the female has moulted her hard shell, when she is so 
soft that she would be injured if seized by the strong 
pincers of the male ; but as she is caught and carried 
about by the male before moulting, she could then be 
seized with impunity. 

Fritz Muller states that certain species of Melita are 
distinguished from all other amphipods by the females 
having ‘‘ the coxal lamellae of the penultimate pair of 
“ feet produced into hook-like processes, of which the 
“ males lay hold with the hands of the first pair.” The 
development of these hook-like processes has probably 
followed from those females which were the most 
securely held during the act of reproduction, having 
left the largest number of offspring. Another Brazilian 
amphipod (Orchestia Daruinii, fig. 8) presents a case

of dimorphism, like that of Tanais ; for there are two 
male forms, which differ in the structure of their 
chelae.^® As either chela would certainly suffice to hold 



the female, — for both are now used for this purpose, — 
the two male forms probably originated by some having

varied in one manner and some in another ; both forms 
having derived certain special, but nearly equal 
advantages, from their differently shaped organs. 

It is not known that male crustaceans fight together 
for the possession of the females, but it is probably the 
case ; for with most animals when the male is larger 
than the female, he seems to owe his greater size to his 
ancestors having fought with other males during many 
generations. In most of the orders, especially in the 
highest or the Brachyura, the male is larger than the 
female; the parasitic genera, however, in which the 
sexes follow different habits of life, and most of the 
Entomostraca must be excepted. The chelae of many 
crustaceans are weapons well adapted for fighting. 
Thus when a Devil-crab {Portunus puber) was seen by 
a son of Mr. Bate fighting with a Careinus masnas, the 
latter was soon thrown on its back, and had every limb 
torn from its body. When several males of a Brazilian 
Gelasimus, a species furnished with immense pincers, 
were placed together in a glass vessel by Fritz Muller, 
they mutilated and killed one another. Mr. Bate put 
a large male Careinus masnas into a pan of water, in- 
habited by a female which was paired with a smaller 
male ; but the latter was soon dispossessed. Mr. Bate 
adds, “ if they fought, the victory was a bloodless one, 
“ for I saw no wounds.” This same naturalist separated 
a male sand-skipper (so common on our sea-shores), 
Gammarus marinus, from its female, both of whom 
were imprisoned in the same vessel with many indivi- 
duals of the same species. The female, when thus 
divorced, soon joined the others. After a time the 
male was put again into the same vessel ; and he then, 
after swimming about for a time, dashed into the crowd, 


Chap. IX.

and without any fighting at once took awa^r his wife. 
This fact shews that in the Amphipoda, an order low 
in the scale, the males and females recognise each 
other, and are mutually attached. 

The mental powers of the Crustacea are probably 
higher than at first sight appears probable. Any one 
who tries to catch one of the shore-crabs, so common 
on tropical coasts, will perceive how wary and alert 
they are. There is a large crab (Birgus latro), found 
on coral islands, which makes a thick bed of the picked 
fibres of the cocoa-nut, at the bottom of a deep burrow. 
It feeds on the fallen fruit of this tree by tearing off 
the husk, fibre by fibre ; and it always begins at that 
end where the three eye-like depressions are situated. 
It then breaks through one of these eyes by hammering 
with its heavy front pincers, and turning round, 
extracts the albuminous core with its narrow posterior 
pincers. But these actions are probably instinctive, so 
that they would be performed as well by a young 
animal as by an old one. The following case, however, 
can hardly be so considered : a trustworthy naturalist, 
Mr. Gardner, whilst watching a shore-crab (Gelasimus) 
making its burrow, threw some shells towards the hole. 
One rolled in, and three other shells remained within a 
few inches of the mouth. In about five minutes the 
crab brought out the shell which had fallen in, and 
carried it away to a distance of a foot ; it then saw the 
three other shells lying near, and evidently thinking 
that they might likewise roll in, carried them to the 
spot where it had laid the first. It would, I think, be

(iifficult to distinguish this act from one performed by 
man by the aid of reason. 

Mr. Bate does not know of any well-marked case of 
difference of colour in the two sexes of our British 
crustaceans, in which respect the sexes of the higher 
animals so often differ. In some cases, however, the 
males and females differ slightly in tint, but Mr. Bate 
thinks not more than may be accounted for by their 
different habits of life, such as by the male wandering 
more about, and being thus more exposed to the light. 
Dr. Power tried to distinguish by colour the sexes of 
the several species which inhabit the Mauritius, but 
failed, except with one species of Squilla, probably 
S. stylifera, the male of which is described as being “ of 
“ a beautiful bluish-green, ” with some of the appendages 
cherry-red, whilst the female is clouded with brown 
and grey, “ with the red about her much less vivid 
“ than in the male.” In this case, we may suspect the 
agency of sexual selection. From M. Bert’s observa- 
tions on Daphnia, when placed in a vessel illuminated 
by a prism, we have reason to believe that even the 
lowest crustaceans can distinguish colours. With 
Saphirina (an oceanic genus of Entomostraca), the males 
are furnished with minute shields or cell-like bodies, 
which exhibit beautiful changing colours ; these are 
absent in the females, and in both sexes of one species.^® 
It would, however, be extremely rash to conclude that 
these curious organs serve to attract the females. I 
am informed by Fritz Muller, that in the female of a 
Brazilian species of Gelasimus, the whole body is of a

nearly uniform greyish-brown. In the male the 
posterior part of the cephalo-thorax is pure white, with 
the anterior part of a rich green, shading into dark 
brown ; and it is remarkable that these colours are 
liable to change in the course of a few minutes — the 
white becoming dirty grey or even black, the green 
losing much of its brilliancy.” It deserves especial 
notice that the males do not acquire their bright 
colours until they become mature. They appear to he 
much more numerous than the females ; they differ 
also in the larger size of their chelae. In some species 
of the genus, probably in all, the sexes pair and 
inhabit the same burrow. They are also, as we have 
seen, highly intelligent animals. From these various 
considerations it seems probable that the male in this 
species has become gaily ornamented in order to attract 
or excite the female. 

It has just been stated that the male Gelasimus does 
not acquire his conspicuous colours until mature and 
nearly ready to breed. This seems a general rule in 
the whole class in respect to the many remarkable 
structural differences between the sexes. We shall 
hereafter find the same law prevailing throughout the 
great sub-kingdom of the Vertebra ta ; and in all cases 
it is eminently distinctive of characters which have 
been acquired through sexual selection. Fritz Muller 
gives some striking instances of this law; thus the 
male sand-hopper (Orchestia) does not, until nearly 
full grown, acquire his large claspers, which are very 
differently constructed from those of the female ; whilst 
young, his claspers resemble those of the female.

generally differ miicli in colour, but the males are often 
darker than the females, as may be seen in Mr. Black- 
wall’s magnificent work.^® In some species, however, 
the difference is conspicuous : thus the female of S'pa- 
rassus smaragdulus is dullish green, whilst the adult 
male has the abdomen of a fine yellow, with three longi- 
tudinal stripes of rich red. In certain species of 
Thomisus the sexes closely resemble each other, in 
others they differ much ; and analogous cases occur in 
many other genera. It is often difficult to say which 
of the two sexes departs most from the ordinary colora- 
tion of the genus to which the species belong ; but 
Mr. Blackwall thinks that, as a general rule, it is the 
male ; and Canestrini remarks that in certain genera 
the males can be specifically distinguished with ease, 
but the females with great difficulty. I am informed 
by Mr. Blackwall that the sexes whilst young usually 
resemble each other ; and both often undergo great 
changes in colour during their successive moults, 
before arriving at maturity. In other cases the male 
alone appears to change colour. Thus the male of the 
above bright-coloured Sparassus at first resembles the 
female, and acquires his peculiar tints only when nearly 
adult. Spiders are possessed of acute senses, and 
exhibit much intelligence ; as is well known, the 
females often shew the strongest affection for their 
eggs, which they carry about enveloped in a silken 
web. The males search eagerly for the females, and

have been seen by Canestrini and others to fight for 
possession of them. This same author says that the 
union of the two sexes has been observed in about 
twenty species; and he asserts positively that the 
female rejects some of the males who court her, 
threatens them with open mandibles, and at last after 
long hesitation accepts the chosen one. From these 
several considerations, we may admit with some con- 
fidence that the well-marked differences in colour 
between the sexes of certain species are the results of 
sexual selection ; though we have not here the best 
kind of evidence, — the display by the male of his 
ornaments. From the extreme variability of colour in 
the male of some species, for instance of Theridion 
lineatum, it would appear that these sexual characters 
of the males have not as yet become well fixed. Canes- 
trini draws the same conclusion from the fact that the 
males of certain species present two forms, differing from 
each other in the size and length of their jaws ; and this 
reminds us of the above cases of dimorphic crustaceans. 

The male is generally much smaller than the female, 
sometimes to an extraordinary degree,^® and he is forced 
to be extremely cautious in making his advances, as 
the female often carries her coyness to a dangerous 
pitch. De Geer saw a male that “ in the midst of his 
“ preparatory caresses was seized by the object of his 
‘‘ attentions, enveloped by her in a web and then 
“ devoured, a sight which, as he adds, filled him with

“horror and indignation.”^^ The Eev. 0. P. Cam- 
bridge accounts in the following manner for the 
extreme smallness of the male in the genus Nephila. 
“ M. Yinson gives a graphic account of the agile way 
“ in which the diminutive male escapes from the 
“ ferocity of the female, by gliding about and playing 
hide and seek over her body and along her gigantic 
“ limbs : in such a pursuit it is evident that the chances 
“ of escape would be in favour of the smallest males, 
“ while the larger ones would fall early victims ; thus 
“ gradually a diminutive race of males would be selected, 
“ until at last they would dwindle to the smallest 
“ possible size compatible with the exercise of their 
“ generative functions, — in fact probably to the size we 
“ now see them, i.e., so small as to he a sort of parasite 
“ upon the female, and either beneath her notice, oi 
“ too agile and too small for her to catch without great 
“ difficulty.” 

Westring has made the interesting discovery that 
the males of several species of Theridion have the 
power of making a stridulating sound, whilst the females 
are mute. The apparatus consists of a serrated ridge 
at the base of the abdomen, against which the hard 
hinder part of the thorax is rubbed ; and of this struc- 
ture not a trace can he detected in the females. It 
deserves notice that several writers, including the well- 
known arachnologist Walckenaer, have declared that

this class, the millipedes and centipedes, can I find any 
well-marked instances of such sexual difierences as 
more particularly concern us. In Glomeris limbata, 
however, and perhaps in some few other species, the 
males differ slightly in colour from the females; but 
this Glomeris is a highly variable species. In the 
males of the Diplopoda, the legs belonging either to 
one of the anterior or of the posterior segments of the 
body are modified into prehensile hooks which serve to 
secure the female. In some species of lulus the tarsi 
of the male are furnished with membranous suckers for 
the same purpose. As we shall see when we treat of 
Insects, it is a much more unusual circumstance, that 
it is the female in Lithobius, which is furnished with 
prehensile appendages at the extremity of her body 
for holding the male.^®

Secondary Sexual Characters of Insects. 

Diversified structures possessed by the males for seizing the females 
— Differences between the sexes, of which the meaning is not 
understood — Difference in size between the sexes — Thysanura 
— Diptera — Hemiptera — Homoptera, musical powers possessed 
by the males alone — Orthoptera, musical instruments of the 
males, much diversified in structure ; pugnacity ; colours — Neu- 
roptera, sexual differences in colour — Hymenoptera, pugnacity 
and colours — Coleoptera, colours ; furnished with great horns, 
apparently as an ornament ; battles ; stridulating organs generally 
common to both sexes. 

In the immense class of insects the sexes sometimes 
differ in their locomotive-organs, and often in their 
sense-organs, as in the pectinated and beautifully 
plumose antennae of the males of many species. In 
Chloeon, one of the Ephemerae, the male has great 
pillared eyes, of which the female is entirely destitute.' 
The ocelli are absent in the females of certain insects, 
as in the Mutillidae ; and here the females are likewise 
wingless. But we are chiefly concerned with structures 
by which one male is enabled to conquer another, 
either in battle or courtship, through his strength, 
pugnacity, ornaments, or music. The innumerable 
contrivances, therefore, by which the male is able to
