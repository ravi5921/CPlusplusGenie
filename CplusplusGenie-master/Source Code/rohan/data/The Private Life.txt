THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

WE talked of London, face to face with a great 
bristling, primeval glacier. The hour and 
the scene were one of those impressions which 
make up a little, in Switzerland, for the modern in 
dignity of travel the promiscuities and vulgarities, 
the station and the hotel, the gregarious patience, 
the struggle for a scrappy attention, the reduction 
to a numbered state. The high valley was pink 
with the mountain rose, the cool air as fresh as if 
the world were young. There was a faint flush of 
afternoon on undiminished snows, and the frater 
nizing tinkle of the unseen cattle came to us with a 
cropped and sun-warmed odour. The balconied 
inn stood on the very neck of the sweetest pass 
in the Oberland, and for a week we had had com 
pany and weather. This was felt to be great luck, 
for one would have made up for the other had 
either been bad. 

The weather certainly would have made up for 
the company ; but it was not subjected to this tax, 
for we had by a happy chance the fieur des pois : 



4 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

Lord and Lady Mellifont, Clare Vawdrey, the 
greatest (in the opinion of many) of our literary 
glories, and Blanche Adney, the greatest (in the 
opinion of all) of our theatrical. I mention these 
first, because they were just the people whom in 
London, at that time, people tried to "get." People 
endeavoured to " bo6k " them six weeks ahead, yet 
on this occasion we had come in for them, we had 
all come in for each other, without the least wire 
pulling. A turn of the game had pitched us together, 
the last of August, and we recognized our luck by 
remaining so, under protection of the barometer. 
When the golden days were over that would come 
soon enough we should wind down opposite sides 
of the pass and disappear over the crest of surround 
ing heights. We were of the same general com 
munion, we participated in the same miscellaneous 
publicity. We met, in London, with irregular 
frequency ; we were more or less governed by 
the laws and the language, the traditions and the 
shibboleths of the same dense social state. I think 
all of us, even the ladies, " did " something, though 
we pretended we didn't when it was mentioned. 
Such things are not mentioned indeed in London, 
but it was our innocent pleasure to be different here. 
There had to be some way to show the difference, 
inasmuch as we were under the impression that this 
was our annual holiday. We felt at any rate that 
the conditions were more human than in London, 
or that at least we ourselves were. We were frank 
about this, we talked about it : it was what we were 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 5 

talking about as we looked at the flushing glacier, 
just as some one called attention to the prolonged 
absence of Lord Mellifont and Mrs. Adney. We 
were seated on the terrace of the inn, where there 
were benches and little tables, and those of us who 
were most bent on proving that we had returned to 
nature were, in the queer Germanic fashion, having 
coffee before meat. 

The remark about the absence of our two com 
panions was not taken up, not even by Lady Melli 
font, not even by little Adney, the fond composer ; 
for it had been dropped only in the briefest inter 
mission of Clare Vawdrey's talk. (This celebrity 
was " Clarence " only on the title-page.) It was 
just that revelation of our being after all human 
that was his theme. He asked the company 
whether, candidly, every one hadn't been tempted 
to say to every one else : " I had no idea you were 
really so nice." I had had, for my part, an idea 
that he was, and even a good deal nicer, but that 
was too complicated to go into then ; besides it is 
exactly my story. There was a general under 
standing among us that when Vawdrey talked we 
should be silent, and not, oddly enough, because he 
at all expected it. He didn't, for of all abundant 
talkers he was the most unconscious, the least 
greedy and professional. It was rather the re 
ligion of the host, of the hostess, that prevailed 
among us : it was their own idea, but they always 
looked for a listening circle when the great novelist 
dined with them. On the occasion I allude to 



6 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

there was probably no one present with whom, 
in London, he had not dined, and we felt the force 
of this habit. He had dined even with me ; and 
on the evening of that dinner, as on this Alpine 
afternoon, I had been at no pains to hold my 
tongue, absorbed as I inveterately was in a study 
of the question which always rose before me, to 
such a height, in his fair, square, strong stature. 

This question was all the more tormenting that 
he never suspected himself (I am sure) of imposing 
it, any more than he had ever observed that every 
day of his life every one listened to him at dinner. 
He used to be called "subjective" in the weekly 
papers, but in society no distinguished man could 
have been less so. He never talked about himself ; 
and this was a topic on which, though it would 
have been tremendously worthy of him, he ap 
parently never even reflected. He had his hours 
and his habits, his tailor and his hatter, his hygiene 
and his particular wine, but all these things to 
gether never made up an attitude. Yet they con 
stituted the only attitude he ever adopted, and it 
was easy for him to refer to our being " nicer " 
abroad than at home. He was exempt from varia 
tions, and not a shade either less or more nice in 
one place than in another. He differed from other 
people, but never from himself (save in the extra 
ordinary sense which I will presently explain), and 
struck me as having neither moods nor sensibilities 
nor preferences. He might have been always in 
the same company, so far as he recognized any 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. / 

influence from age or condition or sex : he ad 
dressed himself to women exactly as he addressed 
himself to men, and gossiped with all men alike, 
talking no better to clever folk than to dull. I 
used to feel a despair at his way of liking one sub 
ject so far as I could tell precisely as much as 
another : there were some I hated so myself. I 
never found him anything but loud and cheerful 
and copious, and I never heard him utter a para 
dox or express a shade or play with an idea. That 
fancy about our being " human " was, in his conver 
sation, quite an exceptional flight His opinions 
were sound and second-rate, and of his perceptions 
it was too mystifying to think. I envied him his 
magnificent health. 

Vawdrey had marched, with his even pace and 
his perfectly good conscience, into the flat country 
of anecdote, where stories are visible from afar 
like windmills and signposts ; but I observed after 
a little that Lady Mellifont's attention wandered. 
I happened to be sitting next her. I noticed that 
her eyes rambled a little anxiously over the lower 
slopes of the mountains. At last, after looking at 
her watch, she said to me : " Do you know where 
they went ? " 

" Do you mean Mrs. Adney and Lord Melli- 
font?" 

" Lord Mellifont and Mrs. Adney." Her lady 
ship's speech seemed unconsciously indeed to 
correct me, but it didn't occur to me that this 
was because she was jealous. I imputed to her 



8 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

no such vulgar sentiment : in the first place, be 
cause I liked her, and in the second because it 
would always occur to one quickly that it was 
right, in any connection, to put Lord Mellifont 
first. He was first extraordinarily first. I don't 
say greatest or wisest or most renowned, but essen 
tially at the top of the list and the head of the 
table. That is a position by itself, and his wife 
was naturally accustomed to see him in it. My 
phrase had sounded as if Mrs. Adney had taken 
him ; but it was not possible for him to be taken 
he only took. No one, in the nature of things, 
could know this better than Lady Mellifont. I had 
originally been rather afraid of her, thinking her, 
with her stiff silences and the extreme blackness of 
almost everything that made up her person, some 
what hard, even a little saturnine. Her paleness 
seemed slightly grey, and her glossy black hair 
metallic, like the brooches and bands and combs 
with which it was inveterately adorned. She was in 
perpetual mourning, and wore numberless orna 
ments of jet and onyx, a thousand clicking chains 
and bugles and beads. I had heard Mrs. Adney 
call her the queen of night, and the term was 
descriptive if you understood that the night was 
cloudy. She had a secret, and if you didn't find it 
out as you knew her better you at least perceived 
that she was gentle and unaffected and limited, 
and also rather submissively sad. She was like 
a woman with a painless malady. I told her that 
I had merely seen her husband and his companion 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 9 

stroll down the glen together about an hour before, 
and suggested that Mr. Adney would perhaps 
know something of their intentions. 

Vincent Adney, who, though he was fifty years 
old, looked like a good little boy on whom it had 
been impressed that children should not talk before 
company, acquitted himself with remarkable sim 
plicity and taste of the position of husband of a 
great exponent of comedy. When all was said 
about her making it easy for him, one couldn't help 
admiring the charmed affection with which he took 
everything for granted. It is difficult for a husband 
who is not on the stage, or at least in the theatre, 
to be graceful about a wife who is ; but Adney 
was more than graceful he was exquisite, he was 
inspired. He set his beloved to music ; and you 
remember how genuine his music could be the 
only English compositions I ever saw a foreigner 
take an interest in. His wife was in them, some 
where, always ; they were like a free, rich transla 
tion of the impression she produced. She seemed, 
as one listened, to pass laughing, with loosened 
hair, across the scene. He had been only a little 
fiddler at her theatre, always in his place during the 
acts ; but she had made him something rare and 
misunderstood. Their superiority had become a 
kind of partnership, and their happiness was a part 
of the happiness of their friends. Adney 's one dis 
comfort was that he couldn't write a play for his 
wife, and the only way he meddled with her affairs 
was by asking impossible people if they couldn't. 



10 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

Lady Mellifont, after looking across at him a 
moment, remarked to me that she would rather 
not put any question to him. She added the next 
minute: "I had rather people shouldn't see I'm 
nervous." 

"Are you nervous ? " 

" I always become so if my husband is away 
from me for any time." 

" Do you imagine something has happened to 
him?" 

" Yes, always. Of course I'm used to it." 

" Do you mean his tumbling over precipices 
that sort of thing ? " 

" I don't know exactly what it is : it's the general 
sense that he'll never come back." 

She said so much and kept back so much that 
the only way to treat the condition she referred 
to seemed the jocular. " Surely he'll never forsake 
you ! " I laughed. 

She looked at the ground a moment. " Oh, at 
bottom I'm easy." 

" Nothing can ever happen to a man so accom 
plished, so infallible, so armed at all points," I 
went on, encouragingly. 

" Oh, you don't know how he's armed ! " she ex 
claimed, with such an odd quaver that I could 
account for it only by her being nervous. This 
idea was confirmed by her moving just afterwards, 
changing her seat rather pointlessly, not as if to 
cut our conversation short, but because she was 
in a fidget. I couldn't know what was the matter 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. II 

with her, but I was presently relieved to see Mrs. 
Adney come toward us. She had in her hand a 
big bunch of wild flowers, but she was not closely 
attended by Lord Mellifont. I quickly saw, how 
ever, that she had no disaster to announce ; yet as 
I knew there was a question Lady Mellifont would 
like to hear answered, but did not wish to ask, 
I expressed to her immediately the hope that his 
lordship had not remained in a crevasse. 

" Oh, no ; he left me but three minutes ago. 
He has gone into the house." Blanche Adney 
rested her eyes on mine an instant a mode of 
intercourse to which no man, for himself, could 
ever object. The interest, on this occasion, was 
quickened by the particular thing the eyes hap 
pened to say. What they usually said was only : 
" Oh, yes, I'm charming, I know, but don't make a 
fuss about it. I only want a new part I do, I 
do ! " At present they added, dimly, surreptitiously, 
and of course sweetly for that was the way they 
did everything : " It's all right, but something did 
happen. Perhaps I'll tell you later." She turned to 
Lady Mellifont, and the transition to simple gaiety 
suggested her mastery of her profession. " I've 
brought him safe. We had a charming walk." 

" I'm so very glad," returned Lady Mellifont, 
with her faint smile ; continuing vaguely, as she 
got up : " He must have gone to dress for dinner. 
Isn't it rather near?" She moved away, to the 
hotel, in her leave-taking, simplifying fashion, and 
the rest of us, at the mention of dinner, looked 



12 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



at each other's watches, as if to shift the responsi 
bility of such grossness. The head-waiter, essen 
tially, like all head-waiters, a man of the world, 
allowed us hours and places of our own, so that in 
the evening, apart under the lamp, we formed 
a compact, an indulged little circle. But it was 
only the Mellifonts who " dressed " and as to whom 
it was recognized that they naturally would dress : 
she in exactly the same manner as on any other 
evening of her ceremonious existence (she was not 
a woman whose habits could take account of any 
thing so mutable as fitness) ; and he, on the other 
hand, with remarkable adjustment and suitability. 
He was almost as much a man of the world as the 
head-waiter, and spoke almost as many languages ; 
but he abstained from courting a comparison of dress- 
coats and white waistcoats, analyzing the occasion in 
a much finer way into black velvet and blue velvet 
and brown velvet, for instance, into delicate harmo 
nies of necktie and subtle informalities of shirt. He 
had a costume for every function and a moral for 
every costume ; and his functions and costumes and 
morals were ever a part of the amusement of life 
a part at any rate of its beauty and romance 
for an immense circle of spectators. For his parti 
cular friends indeed these things were more than an 
amusement ; they were a topic, a social support 
and of course, in addition, a subject of perpetual 
suspense. If his wife had not been present before 
dinner they were what the rest of us probably would 
have been putting our heads together about. 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 13 

Clare Vawdrey had a fund of anecdote on the 
whole question : he had known Lord Mellifont 
almost from the beginning. It was a peculiarity 
of this nobleman that there could be no conversa 
tion about him that didn't instantly take the form 
of anecdote, and a still further distinction that 
there could apparently be no anecdote that was 
not on the whole to his honour. If he had come 
into a room at any moment, people might have 
said frankly : " Of course we were telling stories 
about you ! " As consciences go, in London, the 
general conscience would have been good. More 
over it would have been impossible to imagine his 
taking such a tribute otherwise than amiably, for 
he was always as unperturbed as an actor with the 
right cue. He had never in his life needed the 
prompter his very embarrassments had been re 
hearsed. For myself, when he was talked about 
I always had an odd impression that we were 
speaking of the dead it was with that peculiar 
accumulation of relish. His reputation was a kind 
of gilded obelisk, as if he had been buried beneath 
it ; the body of legend and reminiscence of which 
he was to be the subject had crystallized in advance. 

This ambiguity sprang, I suppose, from the fact 
that the mere sound of his name and air of his person, 
the general expectation he created, were, somehow, 
too exalted to be verified. The experience of his 
urbanity always came later ; the prefigurement, the 
legend paled before the reality. I remember that 
on the evening I refer to the reality was particularly 



14 THE PRIVATE LI IK. 

operative. The handsomest man of his period could 
never have looked better, and he sat among us like a 
bland conductor controlling by an harmonious play of 
arm an orchestra still a little rough. He directed the 
conversation by gestures as irresistible as they were 
vague ; one felt as if without him it wouldn't have 
had anything to call a tone. This was essentially 
what he contributed to any occasion what he 
contributed above all to English public life. He 
pervaded it, he coloured it, he embellished it, and 
without him it would scarcely have had a vocabulary. 
Certainly it would not have had a style ; for a style 
was what it had in having Lord Mellifont. He was 
a style. I was freshly struck with it as, in the salle 
a manger of the little Swiss inn, we resigned our 
selves to inevitable veal. Confronted with his form 
(I must parenthesize that it was not confronted 
much), Clare Vawdrey's talk suggested the reporter 
contrasted with the bard. It was interesting to 
watch the shock of characters from which, of an 
evening, so much would be expected. There was 
however no concussion it was all muffled and 
minimized in Lord Mellifont's tact. It was rudi 
mentary with him to find the solution of such a 
problem in playing the host, assuming responsibili 
ties which carried with them their sacrifice. He 
had indeed never been a guest in his life ; he was 
the host, the patron, the moderator at every board. 
If there was a defect in his manner (and I suggest 
it under my breath), it was that he had a little more 
art than any conjunction even the most compli- 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. I> 

cated could possibly require. At any rate one 
made one's reflections in noticing how the accom 
plished peer handled the situation and how the 
sturdy man of letters was unconscious that the 
situation (and least of all he himself as part of it), 
was handled. Lord Mellifont poured forth treasures 
of tact, and Clare Vawdrey never dreamed he was 
doing it. 

Vawdrey had no suspicion of any such precaution 
even when Blanche Adney asked him if he saw yet 
their third act an inquiry into which she introduced 
a subtlety of her own. She had a theory that he 
was to write her a play and that the heroine, if he 
would only do his duty, would be the part for which 
she had immemorially longed. She was forty years 
old (this could be no secret to those who had 
admired her from the first), and she could now reach 
out her hand and touch her uttermost goal. This 
gave a kind of tragic passion perfect actress of 
comedy as she was to her desire not to miss the 
great thing. The years had passed, and still she had 
missed it ; none of the things she had done was 
the thing she had dreamed of, so that at present 
there was no more time to lose. This was the 
canker in the rose, the ache beneath the smile. It 
made her touching made her sadness even sweeter 
than her laughter. She had done the old English 
and the new French, and had charmed her genera 
tion ; but she was haunted by the vision of a bigger 
chance, of something truer to the conditions that 
lay near her. She was tired of Sheridan and she

hated Bowdler ; she called for a canvas of a finer 
grain. The worst of it, to my sense, was that she 
would never extract her modern comedy from the 
great mature novelist, who was as incapable of pro 
ducing it as he was of threading a needle. She 
coddled him, she talked to him, she made love to 
him, as she frankly proclaimed ; but she dwelt in 
illusions she would have to live and die with 
Bowdler. 

It is difficult to be cursory over this charming 
woman, who was beautiful without beauty and com 
plete with a dozen deficiencies. The perspective of 
the stage made her over, and in society she was like 
the model off the pedestal. She was the picture 
\valking about, which to the artless social mind was 
a perpetual surprise a miracle. People thought 
she told them the secrets of the pictorial nature, in 
return for which they gave her relaxation and tea. 
She told them nothing and she drank the tea ; but 
they had, all the same, the best of the bargain. 
Vawdrey was really at work on a play ; but if he 
had begun it because he liked her I think he let it 
drag for the same reason. He secretly felt the 
atrocious difficulty knew that from his hand the 
finished piece would have received no active life. At 
the same time nothing could be more agreeable than 
to have such a question open with Blanche Adney, 
and from time to time he put something very good 
into the play. If he deceived Mrs. Adney it was only 
because in her despair she was determined to be 
deceived. To her question about their third act he

replied. that, before dinner, he had written a magni 
ficent passage. 

"Before dinner?" I said. "Why, cher maitre, 
before dinner you were holding us all spellbound on 
the terrace." 

My words were a joke, because I thought his had 
been ; but for the first time that I could remember 
I perceived a certain confusion in his face. He 
looked at me hard, throwing back his head quickly, 
the least bit like a horse who has been pulled up 
short. " Oh, it was before that," he replied, natur 
ally enough. 

" Before that you were playing billiards with me" 
Lord Mellifont intimated. 

"Then it must have been yesterday," said 
Vawdrey. 

But he was in a tight place. " You told me this 
morning you did nothing yesterday," the actress 
objected. 

" I don't think I really know when I do things." 
Vawdrey looked vaguely, without helping himself, 
at a dish that was offered him. 

" It's enough if we know," smiled Lord Mellifont. 

" I don't believe you've written a line," said 
Blanche Adney. 

" I think I could repeat you the scene." Vawdrey 
helped himself to haricots verts. 

" Oh, do oh, do ! " two or three of us cried. 

" After dinner, in the salon ; it will be an immense 
regal" Lord Mellifont declared. 

" I'm not sure, but I'll try," Vawdrey went on. 
C

THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



" Oh, you lovely man ! " exclaimed the actress, 
who was practising Americanisms, being resigned 
even to an American comedy. 

" But there must be this condition," said Vawdrey : 
" you must make your husband play." 

" Play while you're reading ? Never ! " 

" I've too much vanity," said Adney. 

Lord Mellifont distinguished him. " You must 
give us the overture, before the curtain rises. That's 
a peculiarly delightful moment." 

" I sha'n't read I shall just speak," said Vawdrey. 

" Better still, let me go and get your manuscript," 
the actress suggested. 

Vawdrey replied that the manuscript didn't matter; 
but an hour later, in the salon, we wished he 
might have had it. We sat expectant, still under 
the spell of Adney's violin. His wife, in the fore 
ground, on an ottoman, was all impatience and 
profile, and Lord Mellifont, in the chair it was 
always the chair, Lord Mellifont's made our grate 
ful little group feel like a social science congress 
or a distribution of prizes. Suddenly, instead of 
beginning, our tame lion began to roar out of tune 
he had clean forgotten every word. He was very 
sorry, but the lines absolutely wouldn't come to 
him ; he was utterly ashamed, but his memory was 
a blank. He didn't look in the least ashamed 
Vawdrey had never looked ashamed in his life ; he 
was only imperturbably and merrily natural. He 
protested that he had never expected to make such 
a fool of himself, but we felt that this wouldn't 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 19 

prevent the incident from taking its place among 
his jolliest reminiscences. It was only we who 
were humiliated, as if he had played us a premedi 
tated trick. This was an occasion, if ever, for 
Lord Mellifont's tact, which descended on us all 
like balm : he told us, in his charming artistic way, 
his way of bridging over arid intervals (he had a 
debit there was nothing to approach it in England 
like the actors of the Com^die Franchise), of his 
own collapse on a momentous occasion, the delivery 
of an address to a mighty multitude, when, finding 
he had forgotten his memoranda, he fumbled, on the 
terrible platform, the cynosure of every eye, fumbled 
vainly in irreproachable pockets for indispensable 
notes. But the point of his story was finer than 
that of Vawdrey's pleasantry ; for he sketched with 
a few light gestures the brilliancy of a performance 
which had risen superior to embarrassment, had re 
solved itself, we were left to divine, into an effort 
recognised at the moment as not absolutely a blot 
on what the public was so good as to call his repu 
tation. 

" Play up play up ! " cried Blanche Adney, tap 
ping her husband and remembering how, on the 
stage, a contretemps is always drowned in music. 
Adney threw himself upon his fiddle, and I said to 
Clare Vawdrey that his mistake could easily be 
corrected by his sending for the manuscript. If he 
would tell me where it was I would immediately 
fetch it from his room. To this he replied : " My 
dear fellow, I'm afraid there is no manuscript." 



2O THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

"Then you've not written anything? " 

" I'll write it to-morrow." 

" Ah, you trifle with us," I said, in much mysti 
fication. 

Vawdrey hesitated an instant. "If there is any 
thing, you'll find it on my table." 

At this moment one of the others spoke to him, 
and Lady Mellifont remarked audibly, as if to 
correct gently our want of consideration, that 
Mr. Adney was playing something very beauti 
ful. I had noticed before that she appeared ex 
tremely fond of music ; she always listened to it in 
a hushed transport. Vawdrey 's attention was drawn 
away, but it didn't seem to me that the words he 
had just dropped constituted a definite permission 
to go to his room. Moreover I wanted to speak to 
Blanche Adney ; I had something to ask her. I 
had to await my chance, however, as we remained 
silent awhile for her husband, after which the con 
versation became general. It was our habit to go 
to bed early, but there was still a little of the even 
ing left. Before it quite waned I found an oppor 
tunity to tell the actress that Vawdrey had given 
me leave to put my hand on his manuscript. She 
adjured me, by all I held sacred, to bring it im 
mediately, to give it to her ; and her insistence was 
proof against my suggestion that it would now 
be too late for him to begin to read : besides which 
the charm was broken the others wouldn't care. 
It was not too late for tier to begin ; therefore I 
was to possess myself, without more delay, of the 






THE PRIVATE LIFE. 21 

precious pages. I told her she should be obeyed 
in a moment, but I wanted her first to satisfy 
my just curiosity. What had happened before 
dinner, while she was on the hills with Lord 
Mellifont ? 

" How do you know anything happened ? " 

" I saw it in your face when you came back." 

" And they call me an actress ! " cried Mrs. 
Adney. 

" What do they call me ? " I inquired. 

" You're a searcher of hearts that frivolous 
thing an observer." 

" I wish you'd let an observer write you a play ! " 
I broke out. 

" People don't care for what you write : you'd 
break any run of luck." 

" Well, I see plays all round me," I declared ; 
" the air is full of them to-night." 

" The air ? Thank you for nothing ! I only wish 
my table-drawers were." 

" Did he make love to you on the glacier ? " I 
went on. 

She stared ; then broke into the graduated 
ecstasy of her laugh. " Lord Mellifont, poor dear ? 
What a funny place ! It would indeed be the place 
for our love ! " 

" Did he fall into a crevasse ? " I continued. 

Blanche Adney looked at me again as she had 
done for an instant when she came up, before 
dinner, with her hands full of flowers. " I don't 
know into what he fell. I'll tell you to-morrow." 



22 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



" He did come down, then ? " 

" Perhaps he went up," she laughed. " It's really 
strange." 

"All the more reason you should tell me to 
night." 

" I must think it over ; I must puzzle it out." 

" Oh, if you want conundrums I'll throw in 
another," I said. " What's the matter with the 
master?" 

" The master of what ? " 

" Of every form of dissimulation. Vawdrey 
hasn't written a line." 

" Go and get his papers and we'll see." 

" I don't like to expose him," I said. 

" Why not, if I expose Lord Mellifont ? " 

"Oh, I'd do anything for that," I conceded. 
" But why should Vawdrey have made a false 
statement ? It's very curious." 

" It's very curious," Blanche Adney repeated, 
with a musing air and her eyes on Lord Mellifont. 
Then, rousing herself, she added : " Go and look in 
his room." 

" In Lord Mellifont's ? " 

She turned to me quickly. " That would be a 
way ! " 

" A way to what ? " 

" To find out to find out ! " She spoke gaily 
and excitedly, but suddenly checked herself. 
" We're talking nonsense," she said. 

"We're mixing things up, but I'm struck with 
your idea. Get Lady Mellifont to let you." 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 23 

" Oh, she has looked ! " Mrs. Adney murmured, 
with the oddest dramatic expression. Then, after a 
movement of her beautiful uplifted hand, as if to 
brush away a fantastic vision, she exclaimed im 
periously : " Bring me the scene bring me the 
scene ! " 

" I go for it," I anwered ; " but don't tell me 
I can't write a play." 

She left me, but my errand was arrested by the 
approach of a lady who had produced a birthday- 
book we had been threatened with it for several 
evenings and who did me the honour to solicit 
my autograph. She had been asking the other^- 
and she couldn't decently leave me out. I I could 
usually remember my name, but it always took me 
some time to recall my date, and even when I had 
done so I was never very sure. I hesitated between 
two days and I remarked to my petitioner that 
I would sign on both if it would give her any satis 
faction. She said that surely I had been born only 
once ; and I replied of course that on the day 
I made her acquaintance I had been born again. 
I mention the feeble joke only to show that, with 
the obligatory inspection of the other autographs, 
we gave some minutes to this transaction. The 
lady departed with her book, and then I became 
aware that the company had dispersed. I was 
alone in the little salon that had been appropriated 
to our use. My first impression was one of disap 
pointment : if Vawdrey had gone to bed I didn't 
wish to disturb him. While I hesitated, however, 



2 4 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



I recognised that Vawdrey had not gone to bed. 
A window was open, and the sound of voices out 
side came in to me : Blanche was on the terrace 
with her dramatist, and they were talking about 
the stars. I went to the window for a glimpse 
the Alpine night was splendid. My friends had 
stepped out together ; the actress had picked up 
a cloak ; she looked as I had seen her look in 
the wing of the theatre. They were silent awhile, 
and I heard the roar of a neighbouring torrent. I 
turned back into the room, and its quiet lamplight 
gave me an idea. Our companions had dispersed 
it was late for a pastoral country and we three 
should have the place to ourselves. Clare Vawdrey 
had written his scene it was magnificent ; and his 
reading it to us there, at such an hour, would be an 
episode intensely memorable. I would bring down 
his manuscript and meet the two with it as they 
came in. 

I quitted the salon for this purpose ; I had been 
in Vawdrey 's room and knew it was on the second 
floor, the last in a long corridor. A minute later 
my hand was on the knob of his door, which I 
naturally pushed open without knocking. It was 
equally natural that in the absence of its occupant 
the room should be dark ; the more so as, the end 
of the corridor being at that hour unlighted, the 
obscurity was not immediately diminished by the 
opening of the door. I was only aware at first 
that I had made no mistake and that, the window- 
curtains not being drawn, I was confronted with a 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 25 

couple of vague starlighted apertures. Their aid, 
however, was not sufficient to enable me to find 
what I had come for, and my hand, in my pocket, 
was already on the little box of matches that I 
always carried for cigarettes. Suddenly I with 
drew it with a start, uttering an ejaculation, an 
apology. I had entered the wrong room ; a glance 
prolonged for three seconds showed me a figure 
seated at a table near one of the windows a figure 
I had at first taken for a travelling-rug thrown over 
a chair. I retreated, with a sense of intrusion ; but 
as I did so I became aware, more rapidly than it 
takes me to express it, in the first place that this 
was Vawdrey's room and in the second that, most 
singularly, Vawdrey himself sat before me. Check 
ing myself on the threshold I had a momentary 
feeling of bewilderment, but before I knew it I had 
exclaimed : " Hullo ! is that you, Vawdrey?" 

He neither turned nor answered me, but my 
question received an immediate and practical reply 
in the opening of a door on the other side of the 
passage. A servant, with a candle, had come out 
of the opposite room, and in this flitting illumi 
nation I definitely recognised the man whom, an 
instant before, I had to the best of my belief left 
below in conversation with Mrs. Adney. His back 
was half turned to me, and he bent over the table 
in the attitude of writing, but I was conscious that 
I was in no sort of error about his identity. " I beg 
your pardon I thought you were downstairs," I 
said ; and as the personage gave no sign of hearing 



26 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

me I added : " If you're busy I won't disturb you." 
I backed out, closing the door I had been in the 
place, I suppose, less than a minute. I had a sense 
of mystification, which however deepened infinitely 
the next instant. I stood there with my hand still 
on the knob of the door, overtaken by the oddest 
impression of my life. Vawdrey was at his table, 
writing, and it was a very natural place for him to 
be ; but why was he writing in the dark and why 
hadn't he answered me ? I waited a few seconds 
for the sound of some movement, to see if he 
wouldn't rouse himself from his abstraction a fit 
conceivable in a great writer and call out : " Oh, 
my dear fellow, is it you ? " But I heard only the 
stillness, I felt only the starlighted dusk of the 
room, with the unexpected presence it enclosed. 
I turned away, slowly retracing my steps, and 
came confusedly downstairs. The lamp was still 
burning in the salon, but the room was empty. I 
passed round to the door of the hotel and stepped 
out. Empty too was the terrace. Blanche Adney 
and the gentleman with her had apparently come 
in. I hung about five minutes ; then I went to 
bed. 

I slept badly, for I was agitated. On looking 
back at these queer occurrences (you will see pre 
sently that they were queer), I perhaps suppose 
myself more agitated than I was ; for great ano 
malies are never so great at first as after we have 
reflected upon them. It takes us some time to 
exhaust explanations. I was vaguely nervous 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 2/ 

I had been sharply startled ; but there was nothing 
I could not clear up by asking Blanche Adney, the 
first thing in the morning, who had been with her 
on the terrace. Oddly enough, however, when 
the morning dawned it dawned admirably I felt 
less desire to satisfy myself on this point than to 
escape, to brush away the shadow of my stupefac 
tion. I saw the day would be splendid, and the 
fancy took me to spend it, as I had spent happy 
days of youth, in a lonely mountain ramble. I 
dressed early, partook of conventional coffee, put 
a big roll into one pocket and a small flask into 
the other, and, with a stout stick in my hand, went 
forth into the high places. My story is not closely 
concerned with the charming hours I passed there 
hours of the kind that make intense memories. 
If I roamed away half of them on the shoulders of 
the hills, I lay on the sloping grass for the other half 
and, with my cap pulled over my eyes (save a peep 
for immensities of view), listened, in the bright still 
ness, to the mountain bee and felt most things sink 
and dwindle. Clare Vawdrey grew small, Blanche 
Adney grew dim, Lord Mellifont grew old, and 
before the day was over I forgot that I had ever 
been puzzled. When in the late afternoon I made 
my way down to the inn there was nothing I wanted 
so much to find out as whether dinner would not 
soon be ready. To-night I dressed, in a manner, 
and by the time I was presentable they were all at 
table. 

In their company again my little problem came 



28 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

back to me, so that I was curious to see if Vawdrey 
wouldn't look at me the least bit queerly. But he 
didn't look at me at all ; which gave me a chance 
both to be patient and to wonder why I should 
hesitate to ask him my question across the table. 
I did hesitate, and with the consciousness of doing 
so came back a little of the agitation I had left 
behind me, or below me, during the day. I wasn't 
ashamed of my scruple, however : it was only a 
fine discretion. What I vaguely felt was that a 
public inquiry wouldn't have been fair. Lord 
Mellifont was there, of course, to mitigate with his 
perfect manner all consequences ; but I think it 
was present to me that with these particular ele 
ments his lordship would not be at home. The 
moment we got up, therefore, I approached Mrs. 
Adney, asking her whether, as the evening was 
lovely, she wouldn't take a turn with me outside. 

" You've walked a hundred miles ; had you not 
better be quiet?" she replied. 

" I'd walk a hundred miles more to get you to tell 
me something." 

She looked at me an instant, with a little of the 
queerness that I had sought, but had not found, in 
Clare Vawdrey's eyes. " Do you mean what became 
of Lord Mellifont ? " 

" Of Lord Mellifont ? " With my new specula 
tion I had lost that thread. 

" Where 's your memory, foolish man ? We 
talked of it last evening." 

" Ah, yes ! " I cried, recalling ; " we shall have 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 29 

lots to discuss." I drew her out to the terrace, and 
before we had gone three steps I said to her : " Who 
was with you here last night ? " 

" Last night ? " she repeated, as wide of the mark 
as I had been. 

"At ten o'clock just after our company broke 
up. You came out here with a gentleman ; you 
talked about the stars." 

She stared a moment ; then she gave her laugh. 
" Are you jealous of dear Vawdrey ? " 

" Then it was he ? " 

" Certainly it was." 

" And how long did he stay ? " 

" You have it badly. He stayed about a quarter 
of an hour perhaps rather more. We walked some 
distance ; he talked about his play. There you have 
it all ; that is the only witchcraft I have used." 

" And what did Vawdrey do afterwards ? " 

" I haven't the least idea. I left him and went to 
bed." 

" At what time did you go to bed ? " 

" At what time did you ? I happen to remember 
that I parted from Mr. Vawdrey at ten twenty-five," 
said Mrs. Adney. " I came back into the salon to 
pick up a book, and I noticed the clock." 

"In other words you and Vawdrey distinctly 
lingered here from about five minutes past ten till 
the hour you mention ? " 

" I don't know how distinct we were, but we were 
very jolly. On voules-vous en venirt" Blanche 
Adney asked. 



30 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

" Simply to this, dear lady : that at the time your 
companion was occupied in the manner you de 
scribe, he was also engaged in literary composition 
in his own room." 

She stopped short at this, and her eyes had an 
expression in the darkness. She wanted to know 
if I challenged her veracity ; and I replied that, on 
the contrary, I backed it up it made the case so 
interesting. She returned that this would only be if 
she should back up mine ; which, however, I had no 
difficulty in persuading her to do, after I had related 
to her circumstantially the incident of my quest of 
the manuscript the manuscript which, at the time, 
for a reason I could now understand, appeared to 
have passed so completely out of her own head. 

" His talk made me forget it I forgot I sent you 
for it. He made up for his fiasco in the salon : he 
declaimed me the scene," said my companion. She 
had dropped on a bench to listen to me and, as we 
sat there, had briefly cross-examined me. Then she 
broke out into fresh laughter. " Oh, the eccentrici 
ties of genius ! " 

" They seem greater even than I supposed." 

" Oh, the mysteries of greatness ! " 

" You ought to know all about them, but they 
take me by surprise." 

" Are you absolutely certain it was Mr. Vawdrey ?" 
my companion asked. 

"If it wasn't he, who in the world was it? That 
a strange gentleman, looking exactly like him, 
should be sitting in his room at that hour of the 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 3! 

night and writing at his table in tJie dark" I 
insisted, " would be practically as wonderful as my 
own contention." 

" Yes, why in the dark ? " mused Mrs. Adney. 

" Cats can see in the dark," I said. 

She smiled at me dimly. " Did it look like a 
cat?" 

" No, dear lady, but I'll tell you what it did look 
like it looked like the author of Vawdrey's admir 
able works. It looked infinitely more like him 
than our friend does himself," I declared. 

" Do you mean it was somebody he gets to do 
them?" 

" Yes, while he dines out and disappoints you." 

" Disappoints me ?" murmured Mrs. Adney art 
lessly. 

"Disappoints me disappoints every one who 
looks in him for the genius that created the pages 
they adore. Where is it in his talk ? " 

" Ah, last night he was splendid," said the actress. 

" He's always splendid, as your morning bath is 
splendid, or a sirloin of beef, or the railway service 
to Brighton. But he's never rare." 

" I see what you mean." 

" That's what makes you such a comfort to talk 
to. I've often wondered now I know. There are 
two of them." 

" What a delightful idea ! " 

" One goes out, the other stays at home. One is 
the genius, the other's the bourgeois, and it's only 
the bourgeois whom we personally know. He talks, 



32 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

he circulates, he's awfully popular, he flirts with 
you" 

"Whereas it's the genius you are privileged to 
see ! " Mrs. Adney broke in. " I'm much obliged 
to you for the distinction." 

I laid my hand on her arm. " See him yourself. 
Try it, test it, go to his room." 

"Go to his room? It wouldn't be proper!" she 
exclaimed, in the tone of her best comedy. 

"Anything is proper in such an inquiry. If you 
see him, it settles it." 

" How charming to settle it ! " She thought a 
moment, then she sprang up. "Do you mean now?" 

" Whenever you like." 

" But suppose I should find the wrong one ? " said 
Blanche Adney, with an exquisite effect. 

" The wrong one ? Which one do you call the 
right ? " 

" The wrong one for a lady to go and see. Sup 
pose I shouldn't find the genius ? " 

" Oh, I'll look after the other," I replied. Then, 
as I had happened to glance about me, I added : 
" Take care here comes Lord Mellifont." 

" I wish you'd look after him" my interlocutress 
murmured. 

" What's the matter with him ? " 

" That's just what I was going to tell you." 

" Tell me now ; he's not coming." 

Blanche Adney looked a moment. Lord Mellifont, 
who appeared to have emerged from the hotel to 
smoke a meditative cigar, had paused, at a distance 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 33 

from us, and stood admiring the wonders of the 
prospect, discernible even in the dusk. We strolled 
slowly in another direction, and she presently said : 
" My idea is almost as droll as yours." 

" I don't call mine droll : it's beautiful." 

" There's nothing so beautiful as the droll," Mrs. 
Adney declared. 

"You take a professional view. But I'm all 
ears." My curiosity was indeed alive again. 

" Well then, my dear friend, if Clare Vawdrey is 
double (and I'm bound to say I think that the more 
of him the better), his lordship there has the oppo 
site complaint : he isn't even whole." 

We stopped once more, simultaneously. " I 
don't understand." 

" No more do I. But I have a fancy that if there 
are two of Mr. Vawdrey, there isn't so much as one, 
all told, of Lord Mellifont." 

I considered a moment, then I laughed out. " I 
think I see what you mean ! " 

" That's what makes you a comfort. Did you 
ever see him alone ? " 

I tried to remember. " Oh, yes ; he has been to 
see me." 

" Ah, then he wasn't alone." 

" And I've been to see him, in his study." 

" Did he know you were there ? " 

" Naturally I was announced." 

Blanche Adney glanced at me like a lovely con 
spirator. " You mustn't be announced ! " With 
this she walked on. 

D 



34 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

I rejoined her, breathless. " Do you mean one 
must come upon him when he doesn't know it ? " 

"You must take him unawares. You must go 
to his room that's what you must do." 

If I was elated by the way our mystery opened 
out, I was also, pardonably, a little confused. "When 
I know he's not there ? " 

" When you know he is." 

" And what shall I see ? " 

" You won't see anything ! " Mrs. Adney cried 
as we turned round. 

We had reached the end of the terrace, and our 
movement brought us face to face with Lord Melli- 
font, who, resuming his walk, had now, without 
indiscretion, overtaken us. The sight of him at 
that moment was illuminating, and it kindled a 
great backward train, connecting itself with one's 
general impression of the personage. As he stood 
there smiling at us and waving a practised hand 
into the transparent night (he introduced the view 
as if it had been a candidate and " supported " the 
very Alps), as he rose before us in the delicate 
fragrance of his cigar and all his other delicacies 
and fragrances, with more perfections, somehow, 
heaped upon his handsome head than one had 
ever seen accumulated before, he struck me as so 
essentially, so conspicuously and uniformly the 
public character that I read in a flash the answer 
to Blanche Adney's riddle. He was all public and 
had no corresponding private life, just as Clare 
Vawdrey was all private and had no corresponding 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 35 

public one. I had heard only half my companion's 
story, yet as we joined Lord Mellifont (he had 
followed us he liked Mrs. Adney ; but it was 
always to be conceived of him that he accepted 
society rather than sought it), as we participated 
for half an hour in the distributed wealth of his 
conversation, I felt with unabashed duplicity that 
we had, as it were, found him out. I was even 
more deeply diverted by that whisk of the curtain 
to which the actress had just treated me than I 
had been by my own discovery ; and if I was not 
ashamed of my share of her secret any more than 
of having divided my own with her (though my 
own was, of the two mysteries, the more glorious 
for the personage involved), this was because there 
was no cruelty in my advantage, but on the con 
trary an extreme tenderness and a positive com 
passion. Oh, he was safe with me, and I felt 
moreover 'rich and enlightened, as if I had suddenly 
put the universe into my pocket. I had learned 
what an affair of the spot and the moment a great 
appearance may be. It would doubtless be too 
much to say that I had always suspected the possi 
bility, in the background of his lordship's being, 
of some such beautiful instance; but it is at least 
a fact that, patronising as it sounds, I had been 
conscious of a certain reserve of indulgence for 
him. I had secretly pitied him for the perfection 
of his performance, had wondered what blank face 
such a mask had to cover, what was left to him for 
the immitigable hours in which a man sits down 



36 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



with himself, or, more serious still, with that intenser 
self, his lawful wife. How was he at home and 
what did he do when he was alone? There was 
something in Lady Mellifont that gave a point to 
these researches something that suggested that 
even to her he was still the public character and 
that she was haunted by similar questionings. She 
had never cleared them up : that was her eternal 
trouble. We therefore knew more than she did, 
Blanche Adney and I ; but we wouldn't tell her for 
the world, nor would she probably thank us for 
doing so. She preferred the relative grandeur of 
uncertainty. She was not at home with him, so 
she couldn't say ; and with her he was not alone, 
so he couldn't show her. He represented to his 
wife and he was a hero to his servants, and what 
one wanted to arrive at was what really became of 
him when no eye could see. He rested, pre 
sumably ; but what form of rest could repair such 
a plenitude of presence? Lady Mellifont was too 
proud to pry, and as she had never looked through 
a keyhole she remained dignified and unassuaged. 

It may have been a fancy of mine that Blanche 
Adney drew out our companion, or it may be that 
the practical irony of our relation to him at such a 
moment made me see him more vividly : at any 
rate he never had struck me as so dissimilar from 
what he would have been if we had not offered him 
a reflection of his image. We were only a con 
course of two, but he had never been more public. 
His perfect manner had never been more perfect, 






THE PRIVATE LIFE. 37 

his remarkable tact had never been more remark 
able. I had a tacit sense that it would all be in 
the morning papers, with a leader, and also a 
secretly exhilarating one that I knew something 
that wouldn't be, that never could be, though any 
enterprising journal would give one a fortune for it. 
I must add, however, that in spite of my enjoy 
ment it was almost sensual, like that of a con 
summate dish I was eager to be alone again with 
Mrs. Adney, who owed me an anecdote. It proved 
impossible, that evening, for some of the others 
came out to see what we found so absorbing ; and 
then Lord Mellifont bespoke a little music from 
the fiddler, who produced his violin and played to 
us divinely, on our platform of echoes, face to face 
with the ghosts of the mountains. Before the 
concert was over I missed our actress and, glancing 
into the window of the salon, saw that she was 
established with Vawdrey, who was reading to her 
from a manuscript. The great scene had apparently 
been achieved and was doubtless the more inte 
resting to Blanche from the new lights she had 
gathered about its author. I judged it discreet not 
to disturb them, and I went to bed without seeing 
her again. I looked out for her betimes the next 
morning and, as the promise of the day was fair, 
proposed to her that we should take to the hills, 
reminding her of the high obligation she had in 
curred. She recognised the obligation and grati 
fied me with her company ; but before we had 
strolled ten yards up the pass she broke out with 



38 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

intensity : " My dear friend, you've no idea how it 
works in me ! I can think of nothing else." 
"Than your theory about Lord Mellifont?" 
" Oh, bother Lord Mellifont ! I allude to yours 
about Mr. Vawdrey, who is much the more inte 
resting person of the two. I'm fascinated by that 
vision of his what-do-you-call-it ? " 
" His alternative identity?" 
" His other self: that's easier to say." 
" You accept it, then, you adopt it ? " 
"Adopt it? I rejoice in it! It became tre 
mendously vivid to me last evening." 
" While he read to you there ? " 
"Yes, as I listened to him, watched him. It 
simplified everything, explained everything." 

" That's indeed the blessing of it. Is the scene 
very fine ? " 

" Magnificent, and he reads beautifully." 
" Almost as well as the other one writes ! " I 
laughed. 

This made my companion stop a moment, laying 
her hand on my arm. " You utter my very im 
pression. I felt that he was reading me the work 
of another man." 

" What a service to the other man ! " 
" Such a totally different person," said Mrs. 
Adney. We talked of this difference as we went 
on, and of what a wealth it constituted, what a 
resource for life, such a duplication of character. 

"It ought to make him live twice as long as other 
people," I observed. 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 39 

" Ought to make which of them ? " 

" Well, both ; for after all they're members of a 
firm, and one of them couldn't carry on the busi 
ness without the other. Moreover mere survival 
would be dreadful for either." 

Blanche Adney was silent a little ; then she ex 
claimed : " I don't know I wish he would survive ! " 

" May I, on my side, inquire which ? " 

" If you can't guess I won't tell you." 

" I know the heart of woman. You always prefer 
the other." 

She halted again, looking round her. " Off here* 
away from my husband, I can tell you. I'm in love 
with him ! " 

" Unhappy woman, he has no passions," I 
answered. 

" That's exactly why I adore him. Doesn't a 
woman with my history know that the passions of 
others are insupportable ? An actress, poor thing, 
can't care for any love that's not all on Jier side ; 
she can't afford to be repaid. My marriage proves 
that : marriage is ruinous. Do you know what was 
in my mind last night, all the while Mr. Vawdrey 
was reading me those beautiful speeches? An 
insane desire to see the author." And dramati 
cally, as if to hide her shame, Blanche Adney 
passed on. 

"We'll manage that," I returned. "I want 
another glimpse of him myself. But meanwhile 
please remember that I've been waiting more than 
forty-eight hours for the evidence that supports

THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



your sketch, intensely suggestive and plausible, 
of Lord Mellifont's private life." 

" Oh, Lord Mellifont doesn't interest me." 

" He did yesterday," I said. 

"Yes, but that was before I fell in love. You 
blotted him out with your story." 

" You'll make me sorry I told it. Come," I 
pleaded, " if you don't let me know how your idea 
came into your head I shall imagine you simply 
made it up." 

" Let me recollect then, while we wander in this 
grassy valley." 

We stood at the entrance of a charming crooked 
gorge, a portion of whose level floor formed the bed 
of a stream that was smooth with swiftness. We 
turned into it, and the soft walk beside the clear 
torrent drew us on and on ; till suddenly, as we 
continued and I waited for my companion to re 
member, a bend of the valley showed us Lady 
Mellifont coming toward us. She was alone, under 
the canopy of her parasol, drawing her sable train 
over the turf ; and in this form, on the devious ways, 
she was a sufficiently rare apparition. She usually 
took a footman, who marched behind her on the 
highroads and whose livery was strange to the 
mountaineers. She blushed on seeing us, as if she 
ought somehow to justify herself; she laughed 
vaguely and said she had come out for a little early 
stroll. We stood together a moment, exchanging 
platitudes, and then she remarked that she had 
thought she might find her husband. 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 4! 

" Is he in this quarter ? " I inquired. 

" I supposed he would be. He came out an hour 
ago to sketch." 

" Have you been looking for him ? " Mrs. Adney 
asked. 

" A little ; not very much," said Lady Mellifont. 

Each of the women rested her eyes with some 
intensity, as it seemed to me, on the eyes of the other. 

" We'll look for him for you, if you like," said 
Mrs. Adney. 

" Oh, it doesn't matter. I thought I'd join him." 

" He won't make his sketch if you don't," my 
companion hinted. 

" Perhaps he will if you do," said Lady Mellifont. 

" Oh, I dare say he'll turn up," I interposed. 

" He certainly will if he knows we're here ! " 
Blanche Adney retorted. 

"Will you wait while we search?" I asked of 
Lady Mellifont. 

She repeated that it was of no consequence ; 
upon which Mrs. Adney went on : " We'll go into 
the matter for our own pleasure." 

" I wish you a pleasant expedition," said her 
ladyship, and was turning away when I sought to 
know if we should inform her husband that she had 
followed him. She hesitated a moment ; then 
she jerked out oddly : " I think you had better not." 
With this she took leave of us, floating a little stiffly 
down the gorge. 

My companion and I watched her retreat, then we 
exchanged a stare, while a light ghost of a laugh

rippled from the actress's lips. "She 
walking in the shrubberies at Mellifont ! " 

" She suspects it, you know," I replied. 

" And she doesn't want him to know it There 
won't be any sketch." 

" Unless we overtake him," I subjoined. " In 
that case we shall find him producing one, in the 
most graceful attitude, and the queer thing is that 
it will be brilliant." 

" Let us leave him alone he'll have to come 
home without it." 

" He'd rather never come home. Oh, he'll find a 
public ! " 

" Perhaps he'll do it for the cows," Blanche 
Adney suggested ; and as I was on the point of 
rebuking her profanity she went on : " That's 
simply what I happened to discover." 

" What are you speaking of? " 

" The incident of day before yesterday." 

" Ah, let's have it at last ! " 

" That's all it was that I was like Lady Melli 
font : I couldn't find him." 

" Did you lose him ? " 

"He lost me that appears to be the way of it. 
He thought I was gone." 

" But you did find him, since you came home with 
him." 

" It was he who found me. That again is what 
must happen. He's there from the moment he 
knows somebody else is." 

" I' understand his intermissions," I said after a 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 43 

short reflection, " but I don't quite seize the law that 
governs them." 

" Oh, it's a fine shade, but I caught it at that 
moment. I had started to come home. I was 
tired, and I had insisted on his not coming back 
with me. We had found some rare flowers those 
I brought home and it was he who had discovered 
almost all of them. It amused him very much, and 
I knew he wanted to get more ; but I was weary and 
I quitted him. He let me go where else would 
have been his tact? and I was too stupid then 
to have guessed that from the moment I was not 
there no flower would be gathered. I started home 
ward, but at the end of three minutes I found I 
had brought away his penknife he had lent it to 
me to trim a branch and I knew he would need it. 
I turned back a few steps, to call him, but before I 
spoke I looked about for him. You can't under 
stand what happened then without having the 
place before you." 

" You must take me there," I said. 

" We may see the wonder here. The place was 
simply one that offered no chance for concealment 
a great gradual hillside, without obstructions or 
trees. There were some rocks below me, behind 
which I myself had disappeared, but from which 
on coming back I immediately emerged again." 

" Then he must have seen you." 

" He was too utterly gone, for some reason best 
known to himself. It was probably some moment 
of fatigue he's getting on, you know, so that, with 



44 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 



the sense of returning solitude, the reaction had been 
proportionately great, the extinction proportionately 
complete. At any rate the stage was as bare as 
your hand." 

" Could he have been somewhere else ? " 

" He couldn't have been, in the time, anywhere 
but where I had left him. Yet the place was 
utterly empty as empty as this stretch of valley 
before us. He had vanished he had ceased to be. 
But as soon as my voice rang out (I uttered his 
name), he rose before me like the rising sun." 

" And where did the sun rise ? " 

"Just where it ought to just where he would 
have been and where I should have seen him had 
he been like other people." 

I had listened with the deepest interest, but it 
was my duty to think of objections. " How long a 
time elapsed between the moment you perceived 
his absence and the moment you called ? " 

"Oh, only an instant. I don't pretend it was long." 

" Long enough for you to be sure ? " I said. 

" Sure he wasn't there ? " 

" Yes, and that you were not mistaken, not the 
victim of some hocus-pocus of your eyesight." 

" I may have been mistaken, but I don't believe 
it. At any rate, that's just why I want you to look 
in his room." 

I thought a moment. " How can I, when even 
his wife doesn't dare to ? " 

" She wants to ; propose it to her. It wouldn't 
take much to make her. She does suspect." 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 45 

I thought another moment. " Did he seem to 
know ? " 

" That I had missed him ? So it struck me, but 
he thought he had been quick enough." 
" Did you speak of his disappearance ? " 
" Heaven forbid ! It seemed to me too strange." 
" Quite right. And how did he look ? " 
Trying to think it out again and reconstitute 
her miracle, Blanche Adney gazed abstractedly up 
the valley. Suddenly she exclaimed : " Just as he 
looks now ! " and I saw Lord Mellifont stand before 
us with his sketch-block. I perceived, as we met 
him, that he looked neither suspicious nor blank : 
he looked simply, as he did always, everywhere, the 
principal feature of the scene. Naturally he had no 
sketch to show us, but nothing could better have 
rounded off our actual conception of him than 
the way he fell into position as we approached. 
He had been selecting his point of view ; he took 
possession of it with a flourish of the pencil. He 
leaned against a rock ; his beautiful little box of 
water-colours reposed on a natural table beside 
him, a ledge of the bank which showed how in- 
veterately nature ministered to his convenience. 
He painted while he talked and he talked while he 
painted ; and if the painting was as miscellaneous 
as the talk, the talk would equally have graced an 
album. We waited while the exhibition went on, 
and it seemed indeed as if the conscious profiles 
of the peaks were interested in his success. They 
grew as black as silhouettes in paper, sharp against 



46 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

a livid sky from which, however, there would be 
nothing to fear till Lord Mellifont's sketch should 
be finished. Blanche Adney communed with me 
dumbly, and I could read the language of her eyes : 
" Oh, if ive could only do it as well as that ! He 
fills the stage in a way that beats us." We could 
no more have left him than we could have quitted 
the theatre till the play was over ; but in due time 
we turned round with him and strolled back to the 
inn, before the door of which his lordship, glancing 
again at his picture, tore the fresh leaf from the 
block and presented it with a few happy words to 
Mrs. Adney. Then he went into the house ; and a 
moment later, looking up from where we stood, we 
saw him, above, at the window of his sitting-room 
(he had the best apartments), watching the signs of 
the weather. 

" He'll have to rest after this," Blanche said, 
dropping her eyes on her water-colour. 

" Indeed he will ! " I raised mine to the window : 
Lord Mellifont had vanished. " He's already re- 
absorbed." 

" Reabsorbed ? " I could see the actress was now 
thinking of something else. 

" Into the immensity of things. He has lapsed 
again ; there's an entr'acte? 

" It ought to be long." Mrs. Adney looked up 
and down the terrace, and at that moment the 
head -waiter appeared in the doorway. Suddenly 
she turned to this functionary with the question : 
" Have you seen Mr. Vawdrey lately ? " 






THE PRIVATE LIFE. 47 

The man immediately approached. " He left the 
house five minutes ago for a walk, I think. He 
went down the pass ; he had a book." 

I was watching the ominous clouds. " He had 
better have had an umbrella." 

The waiter smiled. " I recommended him to 
take one." 

" Thank you," said Mrs. Adney ; and the Ober- 
kellner withdrew. Then she went on, abruptly : 
" Will you do me a favour ? " 

" Yes, if you'll do me one. Let me see if your 
picture is signed." 

She glanced at the sketch before giving it to me. 
" For a wonder it isn't." 

" It ought to be, for full value. May I keep it 
awhile ? " 

" Yes, if you'll do what I ask. Take an umbrella 
and go after Mr. Vawdrey." 

" To bring him to Mrs. Adney ? " 

" To keep him out as long as you can." 

" I'll keep him as long as the rain holds off." 

" Oh, never mind the rain ! " my companion 
exclaimed. 

" Would you have us drenched ? " 

" Without remorse." Then with a strange light 
in her eyes she added : " I'm going to try." 

" To try ? " 

" To see the real one. Oh, if I can get at him ! " 
she broke out with passion. 

" Try, try ! " I replied. " I'll keep our friend all 
day." 



48 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

" If I can get at the one who does it" and she 
paused, with shining eyes " if I can have it out 
with him I shall get my part ! " 

" I'll keep Vawdrey for ever ! " I called after her 
as she passed quickly into the house. 

Her audacity was communicative, and I stood 
there in a glow of excitement. I looked at Lord 
Mellifont's water-colour and I looked at the gather 
ing storm ; I turned my eyes again to his lordship's 
windows and then I bent them on my watch. 
Vawdrey had so little the start of me that I should 
have time to overtake him time even if I should 
take five minutes to go up to Lord Mellifont's 
sitting-room (where we had all been hospitably 
received), and say to him, as a messenger, that 
Mrs. Adney begged he would bestow upon his 
sketch the high consecration of his signature. As 
I again considered this work of art I perceived 
there was something it certainly did lack : what 
else then but so noble an autograph? It was my 
duty to supply the deficiency without delay, and 
in accordance with this conviction I instantly re- 
entered the hotel. I went up to Lord Mellifont's 
apartments ; I reached the door of his salon. 
Here, however, I was met by a difficulty of which 
my extravagance had not taken account. If I 
were to knock I should spoil everything ; yet was 
I prepared to dispense with this ceremony ? I 
asked myself the question, and it embarrassed me ; 
I turned my little picture round and round, but 
it didn't give me the answer I wanted. I wanted 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 49 

it to say : " Open the door gently, gently, without a 
sound, yet very quickly : then you will see what you 
will see." I had gone so far as to lay my hand 
upon the knob when I became aware (having my 
wits so about me), that exactly in the manner I was 
thinking of gently, gsntly, without a sound 
another door had moved, on the opposite side of 
the hall. At the same instant I found myself 
smiling rather constrainedly upon Lady Mellifont, 
who, on seeing me, had checked herself on the 
threshold of her room. For a moment, as she stood 
there, we exchanged two or three ideas that were 
the more singular for being unspoken. We had 
caught each other hovering, and we understood 
each other ; but as I stepped over to her (so that 
we were separated from the sitting-room by the 
width of the hall), her lips formed the almost sound 
less entreaty : " Don't !" I could see in her conscious 
eyes everything that the word expressed the con 
fession of her own curiosity and the dread of the 
consequences of mine. "Dorit!" she repeated, as 
I stood before her. From the moment my experi 
ment could strike her as an act of violence I was 
ready to renounce it ; yet I thought I detected in 
her frightened face a still deeper betrayal a possi 
bility of disappointment if I should give way. It 
was as if she had said : " I'll let you do it if you'll 
take the responsibility. Yes, with some one else 
I'd surprise him. But it would never do for him to 
think it was I." 

" We soon found Lord Mellifont," I observed, in 
E 




5O THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

^allusion to our encounter with her an hour before, 
'jfflfod he was so good as to give this lovely sketch 

to Mrs. Adney, who has asked me to come up and 
beg him to put in the omitted signature." 
n Lady Mellifont took the drawing from me, and I 
could guess the struggle that went on in her while 

/she looked at it. She was silent for some time ; 

then I felt that all her delicacies and dignities, all 
her old timidities and pieties were fighting against 
her opportunity. She turned away from me and, 
with the drawing, went back to her room. She was 
absent for a couple of minutes, and when she re 
appeared I could see that she had vanquished her 
temptation ; that even, with a kind of resurgent 
horror, she had shrunk from it. She had deposited 
the sketch in the room. " If you will kindly leave 
the picture with me, I will see that Mrs. Adney 's 
request is attended to," she said, with great courtesy 
and sweetness, but in a manner that put an end to 
our colloquy. 

I assented, with a somewhat artificial enthusiasm 
perhaps, and then, to ease off our separation, 
remarked that we were going to have a change of 
weather. 

" In that case we shall go we shall go imme 
diately," said Lady Mellifont. I was amused at 
the eagerness with which she made this declara 
tion : it appeared to represent a coveted flight into 
safety, an escape with her threatened secret. I was 
the more surprised therefore when, as I was turning 
away, she put out her hand to take mine. She had 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 51 

the pretext of bidding me farewell, but as I shook 
hands with her on this supposition I felt that what 
the movement really conveyed was : " I thank you 
for the help you would have given me, but it's 
better as it is. If I should know, who would help 
me then?" As I went to my room to get my 
umbrella I said to myself : " She's sure, but she 
won't put it to the proof." 

A quarter of an hour later I had overtaken Clare 
Vawdrey in the pass, and shortly after this we found 
ourselves looking for refuge. The storm had not 
only completely gathered, but it had broken at the 
last with extraordinary rapidity. We scrambled 
up a hillside to an empty cabin, a rough structure 
that was hardly more than a shed for the protection 
of cattle. It was a tolerable shelter however, and 
it had fissures through which we could watch the 
splendid spectacle of the tempest. This entertain 
ment lasted an hour an hour that has remained 
with me as full of odd disparities. While the 
lightning played with the thunder and the rain 
gushed in on our umbrellas, I said to myself that 
Clare Vawdrey was disappointing. I don't know 
exactly what I should have predicated of a great 
author exposed to the fury of the elements, I can't 
say what particular Manfred attitude I should have 
expected my companion to assume, but it seemed 
to me somehow that I shouldn't have looked to 
him to regale me in such a situation with stories 
(which I had already heard), about the celebrated 
Lady Ringrose. Her ladyship formed the subject 



52 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

of Vawdrey's conversation during this prodigious 
scene, though before it was quite over he had 
launched out on Mr. Chafer, the scarcely less 
notorious reviewer. It broke my heart to hear a 
man like Vawdrey talk of reviewers. The lightning 
projected a hard clearness upon the truth, familiar 
to me for years, to which the last day or two had 
added transcendent support the irritating certi 
tude that for personal relations this admirable 
genius thought his second-best good enough. It 
^vas, no doubt, as society was made, but there was 
a contempt in the distinction which could not fail 
to be galling to an admirer. The world was vulgar 
and stupid, and the real man would have been a 
fool to come out for it when he could gossip and 
dine by deputy. None the less my heart sank as I 
felt my companion practice this economy. I don't 
know' exactly what I wanted ; I suppose I wanted 
him to make an exception for me. I almost 
believed he would, if he had known how I wor 
shipped his talent. But I had never been able to 
translate this to him, and his application of his 
principle was relentless. At any rate I was more 
than ever sure that at such an hour his chair at 
home was not empty : there was the Manfred 
attitude, there were the responsive flashes. I could 
only envy Mrs. Adney her presumable enjoyment 
of them. 

The weather drew off at last, and the rain abated 
sufficiently to allow us to emerge from our asylum 
and make our way back to the inn, where we found 



THE PRIVATE LIFE. 53 

on our arrival that our prolonged absence had pro 
duced some agitation. It was judged apparently 
that the fury of the elements might have placed us 
in a predicament. Several of our friends were at 
the door, and they seemed a little disconcerted 
when it was perceived that we were only drenched. 
Clare Vawdrey, for some reason, was wetter than 
I, and he took his course to his room. Blanche 
Adney was among the persons collected to look out 
for us, but as Vawdrey came toward her she shrank 
from him, without a greeting ; with a movement 
that I observed as almost one of estrangement she 
turned her back on him and went quickly into the 
salon. Wet as I was I went in after her ; on which 
she immediately flung round and faced me. The 
first thing I saw was that she had never been so 
beautiful. There was a light of inspiration in her 
face, and she broke out to me in the quickest 
whisper, which was at the same time the loudest 
cry, I have ever heard : " I've got my part! " 
" You went to his room I was right ? " 
"Right?" Blanche Adney repeated. "Ah, my 
dear fellow ! " she murmured. 
" He was there you saw him ? " 
" He saw me. It was the hour of my life ! " 
" It must have been the hour of his, if you were 
half as lovely as you are at this moment." 

" He's splendid," she pursued, as if she didn't 
hear me. " He is the one who does it ! " I listened, 
immensely impressed, and she added : " We under 
stood each other." 



54 THE PRIVATE LIFE. 

" By flashes of lightning ? " 

" Oh, I didn't see the lightning then ! " 

" How long were you there ? " I asked with 
admiration. 

" Long enough to tell him I adore him." 

" Ah, that's what I've never been able to tell 
him ! " I exclaimed ruefully. 

" I shall have my part I shall have my part ! " 
she continued, with triumphant indifference ; and 
she flung round the room with the joy of a girl, 
only checking herself to say : " Go and change your 
clothes." 

" You shall have Lord Mellifont's signature," I 
said. 

" Oh, bother Lord Mellifont's signature ! He's far 
nicer than Mr. Vawdrey," she went on irrelevantly. 

" Lord Mellifont?" I pretended to inquire. 

" Confound Lord Mellifont ! " And Blanche 
Adney, in her elation, brushed by me, whisking 
again through the open door. Just outside of it 
she came upon her husband ; whereupon, with a 
charming cry of " We're talking of you, my love ! " 
she threw herself upon him and kissed him. 

I went to my room and changed my clothes, but 
I remained there till the evening. The violence of 
the storm had passed over us, but the rain had 
settled down to a drizzle. On descending to 
dinner I found that the change in the weather had 
already broken up our party. The Mellifonts had 
departed in a carriage and four, they had been 
followed by others, and several vehicles had been 




THE PRIVATE LIFE. 55 

bespoken for the morning. Blanche Adney's was 
one of them, and on the pretext that she had pre 
parations to make she quitted us directly after 
dinner. Clare Vawdrey asked me what was the 
matter with her she suddenly appeared to dislike 
him. I forget what answer I gave, but I did my 
best to comfort him by driving away with him the 
next day. Mrs. Adney had vanished when we 
came down ; but they made up their quarrel in 
London, for he finished his play, which she pro 
duced. I must add that she is still, nevertheless, in 
want of the great part. I have a beautiful one in 
my head, but she doesn't come to see me to stir 
me up about it. Lady Mellifont always drops 
me a kind word when we meet, but that doesn't 
console me.
